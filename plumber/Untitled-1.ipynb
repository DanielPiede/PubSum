      "The inflammatory process of Crohnâs disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC), which are the two main forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), is thought to be driven by the infiltration of dysregulated proinflammatory immune cells into the inflamed intestinal tissue. This infiltration is facilitated by the interaction between the integrin Î±4Î²7, which is expressed on several circulating immune cell subsets including previously activated Tâcells, and its counterreceptor Mucosal Addressin Cell Adhesion Moleculeâ1 (MAdCAMâ1), which is selectively expressed on the endothelial cells of intestinal venules. \n",
      "Vedolizumab is a humanised monoclonal IgG1 antibody that binds to Î±4Î²7 and inhibits the interaction with MAdCAMâ1. This prevents Î±4Î²7âexpressing immune cells from extravasating which leads to a decrease in local inflammatory activity. More recently, vedolizumab has been shown to modulate innate immunity, including macrophage and dendritic cell populations, in addition to adaptive immunity. The limited expression pattern of MAdCAMâ1 is thought to account for vedolizumabâs gutâspecific immunosuppressive effect which in turn translates into a beneficial safety profile. \n",
      "Vedolizumab is approved for the treatment of patients with moderateâtoâsevere CD or UC, where treatment with conventional therapy or an antiâTNF agent has failed. Vedolizumab was originally developed for administration via intravenous (IV) infusions. Recently, a formulation for subcutaneous (SC) administration was approved for maintenance treatment following at least two IV infusions. This approval was based on the phase III trials VISIBLE 1 and VISIBLE 2 which evaluated SC vedolizumab treatment after two initial IV doses in CD and UC patients, respectively. The proportion of subjects in clinical remission 52 weeks after the start of treatment, which was the primary endpoint, was significantly higher in the SC vedolizumabâtreated group compared to the placebo group, in both trials. Median trough concentrations at steady state during SC vedolizumab were 30.2 and 34.6Â Î¼g/ml for CD and UC patients, respectively, which was substantially higher than the median trough level during IV treatment presented in VISIBLE 1 (11.1Â Î¼g/ml). In contrast, the average serum concentrations over time were rather similar (39.8 and 32.2Â Î¼g/ml, during SC and IV treatment, respectively). Finally, there were no new safety issues observed, other than the incidence of injectionâsite reaction frequencies. However, data on patient experience or satisfaction were not presented in the VISIBLE publications, and studies to investigate the efficacy and safety of switching patients from maintenance IV to maintenance SC vedolizumab treatment in a realâworld setting are scarce. To our knowledge, there is only one report on the topic, and in that study, the followâup time after the switch was only 12âweeks. Given that the halfâlife of the drug is approximately 26âdays and that the washâout period is several months, such a short followâup time may not be adequate to examine the effectiveness of the SC formulation. Nevertheless, the authors described a 52% increase (pâ<â0.01) in the patients' faecal calprotectin levels at the end of their study which was rather unexpected. Thus, further studies are warranted.\n",
      "There are several potential benefits with SC as compared to IV administration of vedolizumab including a reduced burden of health care resources and increased patient convenience. Potential caveats with SC treatment are increased difficulties to ensure therapy compliance, fewer builtâin disease followâup visits, possible IV treatment preference and local skin reactions to SC injections.\n",
      "The aims of this study were to assess efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics, patient experience, patient satisfaction, and potential cost savings following a switch from IV to SC vedolizumab treatment in patients with inflammatory bowel disease in a realâworld setting.\n",
      "This was a prospective observational cohort study of a switch from maintenance IV to SC vedolizumab treatment in a population of adult IBD patients. The study was conducted at the Skane University Hospital, Sweden, with a 6âmonth followâup period. Consecutive patients were approached regarding participation. Inclusion criteria comprised signed informed consent; diagnosis of CD, UC or IBDâunclassified; and ongoing maintenance treatment with IV vedolizumab (previously received â¥3 doses of IV vedolizumab). Exclusion criteria comprised noticeable difficulties handling an SC injector pen, inability to give informed consent, or inability to comply with study procedures. The study was performed in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Ethical permission was granted by the regional research ethics committee in Lund, Sweden (DNR 2018/761). All patients provided written informed consent to participation before study entry.\n",
      "Patients were enrolled between December 2020 and June 2021. The study included a baseline visit, scheduled at the timeâpoint when the patient should have received the next dose of IV vedolizumab, and a followâup visit 6âmonths after the switch. A subset of patients, that was the first to be enrolled, could be evaluated also after 12Â months. Additional visits were scheduled on demand in case of a suspected disease flare or potential side effects. All patients were switched to a dose of 108âmg vedolizumab SC every 2âweeks regardless of previous dose or dosing interval on IV vedolizumab. All conventional IBD treatments were permitted during the study and changes in the treatment regimen were allowed if clinically indicated. Dose optimization of SC vedolizumab to 108âmg weekly was done at the discretion of the treating physician based on a combination of clinical symptoms and biomarker levels. Any changes in treatment regimen throughout the study period were recorded.\n",
      "Baseline data recorded included diagnosis (CD, UC or IBDâunclassified), gender, age at diagnosis, age at inclusion, weight, height, smoking status, time on IV vedolizumab before the switch, IV vedolizumab dose and dosing interval at inclusion, previous and current IBD treatment, disease characteristics according to the Montreal classification, and disease activity at baseline.\n",
      "The primary endpoint was change in disease activity defined by faecal calprotectin levels at 6âmonths after the switch to SC vedolizumab treatment. Faecal calprotectin is a sensitive and nonâsubjective measure of disease activity that is not affected by placebo or nocebo effects. It reacts to an early increase in subclinical inflammatory activity and is expected to change earlier than clinical symptom levels in the event of a diminished therapeutic effect.\n",
      "Secondary endpoints were [all refer to 6âmonths of followâup unless otherwise indicated] (a) change in remission rates defined by a faecal calprotectin <150âÎ¼g/g and clinical disease activity indices: for CD patientâbased Harvey Bradshaw Index (HBI) â¤4 or PatientâReported Outcomes (PRO)2âCD â¤11 and for UC Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index (SCCAI) â¤2 or PRO2âUCÂ =Â 0. PRO2 scores were applied in accordance with the STRIDE documents. Briefly, the PRO2âCD is the sum of the daily soft or liquid stool frequency and abdominal pain (multiplied by the weighting factors 2 and 5, respectively) items from the Crohnâs Disease Activity Index, whereas the PRO2âUC is the simple sum of the stool frequency and rectal bleeding items from the Mayo score; (b) change in the laboratory biomarker plasma Câreactive protein (CRP); (c) change in clinical disease activity defined by the patientâbased HBI for CD and the SCCAI for UC, as well as symptom levels according to the PatientâReported Outcomes (PRO)â2 criteria as described in the STRIDE documents; (d) subgroup analyses of patients that were dose optimised on IV vedolizumab, and patients with perianal CD, respectively; (e) subgroup analysis of patients that completed 12Â months of followâup, including drug persistence (11 patients that had not completed 12Â months of followâup but remained on the drug were censored), and evaluation of faecal calprotectin and plasma CRP levels. When all patients had completed the first 6âmonths of followâup, the study was closed and thus not all patients completed 12Â months of followâup; (f) adverse events and local injection reactions; (g) serum vedolizumab trough levels and relation to faecal calprotectin levels (patients categorised into quartiles based on serum vedolizumab trough levels and median faecal calprotectin levels calculated per quartile), and SC vedolizumab dose optimization rates; (h) patient experience of switching from IV to SC treatment, overall injection experience and patient satisfaction with various aspects of the injector pen [see below for details]; (i) healthârelated qualityâofâlife using the Short Health Scale (SHS) which is a validated fourâitem questionnaire (symptom burden, social function, diseaseârelated worry and general wellâbeing; each item scored 0â5 with an SHS composite score ranging from 0 to 20) and (j) annualised cost savings per patient with SC as compared to IV treatment.\n",
      "Faecal calprotectin levels were analysed using an enzymeâlinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; PhiCal, Calpro AS). Serum vedolizumab trough levels were analysed by a Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) validated inâhouse developed chemiluminescence ELISA at the Karolinska Institute (Stockholm, Sweden). Both methods are used in clinical routine care and the analyses were performed in clinical laboratories.\n",
      "Adverse events that occurred after study entry considered related or of possible relation to SC vedolizumab treatment or switch were documented. Local injection reactions including discomfort, pain, burning sensation and erythema; and patient satisfaction with the injector pen, overall injection experience, the experience of switching from IV to SC treatment; were evaluated using structured questionnaires (see TableÂ 1 and TableÂ S1 for details on items, questions asked and response options). The questions and response options were adapted from previously published questionnaires used in similar studies. \n",
      "Annualised treatment costs for IV treatment included the cost of an appointment with a nurse for drug administration and the cost of the drug. Treatment costs of SC treatment included annual drug costs only. The rates of patients that were dose escalated on IV and SC treatment, respectively, were accounted for in the calculation.\n",
      "Data are presented as mean values with standard deviation (SD), or median values with interquartile range (IQR) as appropriate. Prism 9 for Mac OS X version 9.3.1 (GraphPad Software, Inc.) was used for statistical analyses and to graph data. The pairedâsamples Studentâs tâtest alternatively the Wilcoxon matchedâpair signedârank test was used to compare baseline and followâup data for changes in laboratory biomarkers, disease activity indices and qualityâofâlife scores as appropriate depending on data scale type and data distribution. Missing data are shown by presenting numbers of data points in the figures. The complete case analysis method was applied, which together with an account of discontinued patients and data point numbers presented, was deemed to give the most adequate description of the cohort. The approach was verified by performing sensitivity analyses comprising bestâ and worstâcase scenario calculations (i.e. missing data equals relapse and remission, respectively), neither of which altered the statistical significance as compared with the complete case analysis. Regarding faecal calprotectinâmissing data, the missingâatârandom assumption is plausible and the complete case analysis is thus adequate to apply. The KruskalâWallis test was used to assess differences in faecal calprotectin levels between patient groups stratified by serum vedolizumab trough level quartiles during IV and SC vedolizumab treatment, respectively. The chiâsquare test was used to compare remission rates between groups. KaplanâMeier survival analysis was used to calculate drug persistence. A statistically significant test result was defined by pâ<â0.05.\n",
      "Eightyânine patients (48 patients with CD, 41 patients with UC and no patients with IBDâunclassified) were included in the study. In total, 102 patients were approached regarding participation. Twelve patients declined participation, and one patient did not meet the inclusion criteria (FigureÂ 1). Baseline patient characteristics, clinical disease activity scores, laboratory biomarkers, concomitant IBD treatment and time on IV vedolizumab are presented in TableÂ 2. Details on previous IBD treatments and changes during followâup are presented in TableÂ S2. The median time on IV vedolizumab before the switch was 26.1âmonths (IQR 9.5â52.9). The wide IQR illustrates heterogeneity in terms of previous exposure time to vedolizumab. At baseline, four patients received low dose oral prednisolone (1.25â10Â mg daily), and three patients received oral budesonide. Prednisolone could be discontinued in one of these patients. Results refer to 6 months followâup, unless otherwise specified.\n",
      "For the cohort as a whole and the subgroup of CD patients, significant decreases in faecal calprotectin median levels were observed following the switch, whereas no change was seen in UC patients (FigureÂ 2A). The remission rates as defined by faecal calprotectin remained stable for all three groups (FigureÂ 2B). A subgroup analysis of faecal calprotectin levels in patients with limited ileal CD showed a median of 145âÎ¼g/g (IQR 48â281) at baseline and 94âÎ¼g/g (IQR 50.0â175.5) at followâup. The corresponding values for the entire CD group were 64.0 (IQR 12.5â238.5) Î¼g/g and 49.0Â Î¼g/g (IQR 12.5â161.8), respectively. Analyses of plasma CRP levels did not show any significant changes before compared with after switch for the cohort as a whole, nor in the CD and UC subgroups (data not shown).\n",
      "Clinical disease activity in patients with CD, as measured by average patientâbased HBI and PRO2âCD scores, remained unchanged (FigureÂ 3A). Patients with UC displayed a statistically significant improvement in clinical symptoms according to the SCCAI although the median score remained unchanged, while the PRO2âUC score did not show a significant change (FigureÂ 3C). There were no statistically significant changes in the proportions of patients displaying clinical remission, as defined by patientâbased HBI â¤4 or PRO2âCD â¤11 for patients with CD, and by SCCAI â¤2 or PRO2âUCÂ =Â 0 for patients with UC (FigureÂ 3B,D).\n",
      "At baseline, 10 patients had a diagnosis of perianal CD. Three of these had active perianal disease at baseline, and at followâup, this number was two.\n",
      "Twenty patients were on optimised IV vedolizumab dosing at baseline. At followâup, there was no significant change in their faecal calprotectin levels, whereas the 69 patients that had been on standard IV vedolizumab dosing showed a small but significant decrease (FigureÂ 4A). Faecal calprotectin remission rates (FigureÂ 4A) and plasma CRP median values (data not shown) remained unchanged in both groups. Clinical remission rates remained stable at followâup (FigureÂ 4B,C) except for the PRO2âUC remission rate for UC patients that had been on standard IV vedolizumab dosing, where a statistically significant improvement was seen (FigureÂ 4C).\n",
      "Dose optimization of SC vedolizumab to 108âmg weekly was deemed indicated in 10.1% of patients (6 CD, 3 UC). Three of these (1 CD, 2 UC) belonged to the subgroup of 20 patients (22.5%) that had been on intensified IV vedolizumab dosing before the switch, whereas the other 17 (85%) remained on standard SC dosing. All patients with perianal CD (nÂ =Â 10) remained on treatment, but 3/10 were dose optimised to SC vedolizumab 108âmg weekly. No patient required hospitalisation or IV corticosteroid treatment due to disease worsening during the study.\n",
      "A subset of patients was evaluated at 12Â months after the switch, in addition to the more comprehensive evaluation after the primary followâup period of 6âmonths. Drug persistence at 6 and 12Â months were 95.5% (85/89) and 88.5% (69/78), respectively, for the whole cohort (FigureÂ 5). Reasons for drug discontinuation (nÂ =Â 9) were disease worsening in five patients, change in treatment regimen due to extraintestinal manifestations (present before the switch) in one patient, local injection reaction in one patient and adverse events in two patients (headache and repeated infections). There were no statistically significant changes in plasma CRP levels for the whole cohort (nÂ =Â 50), CD (nÂ =Â 27) or UC (nÂ =Â 23); or in faecal calprotectin levels for the whole cohort (nÂ =Â 20), CD (nÂ =Â 10) or UC (nÂ =Â 10), at 12Â months (data not shown).\n",
      "Median serum vedolizumab trough levels at steady state on IV treatment (i.e. at baseline) were 8.1Â Î¼g/ml (IQR 5.2â14âÎ¼g/ml) for the whole cohort, 8.7Â Î¼g/ml (IQR 4.9â14.0Â Î¼g/ml) in CD patients, and 7.9Â Î¼g/ml (IQR 5.3â12.5Â Î¼g/ml) in UC patients. Median serum vedolizumab trough levels at steady state on SC treatment (i.e. at 6âmonths followâup) were 19.0Â Î¼g/ml (IQR 13.0â23.0Â Î¼g/ml) for the whole cohort, 19.0Â Î¼g/ml (IQR 12.0â22.8Â Î¼g/ml) in CD patients, and 18.5Â Î¼g/ml (IQR 15.0â23.8Â Î¼g/ml) in UC patients. When patients were on IV treatment, we found significantly higher faecal calprotectin levels, primarily among CD patients, in the quartiles with the lowest serum vedolizumab trough levels compared to those with higher serum vedolizumab trough levels (FigureÂ 6A). This relationship was not observed after patients had been on SC treatment for 6Â months (FigureÂ 6B).\n",
      "We observed no differences in the SHS composite score or separate SHS items (FigureÂ S1). Patient satisfaction with the injector pen (all eight categories; see TableÂ S1 for details) was high with 94.1%â100% of patients responding âstrongly agreeâ, âagreeâ or âagree to some extentâ (FigureÂ 7A). Overall satisfaction with the injection experience was generally high with 96.4% of the patients reporting being satisfied or very satisfied (FigureÂ 7B). Generally, patients favoured SC administration over IV (FigureÂ 7C). Only 2.4â9.4% of patients reported a slight preference for IV treatment over SC. Conversely, 55.3% of patients experienced SC treatment as slightly or clearly more effective, and 85.9% slightly or clearly more convenient (FigureÂ 7C). Regarding overall feeling of security, no preference was the most frequent response (58.8%) and a slight preference for IV treatment was reported by 9.4% of patients (FigureÂ 7C). Taking all aspects that follow with the given route of administration into account, 83.3% of patients reported a preference for SC over IV treatment, whereas the opposite was true for 2.4% of patients (FigureÂ 7C).\n",
      "All reported adverse events are presented in TableÂ 1. Adverse events, excluding local injection reactions, occurred in 15 (31.3%) of CD patients and 10 (24.4%) of UC patients. The corresponding rates for IV treatment were 27.1% and 22.0%, respectively. Some patients reported several side effects. The most common complaint was fatigue, followed by headache, nausea and rash. No serious adverse events were reported. Data on local skin reactions including discomfort, pain, burning sensation and erythema are presented in TableÂ 1. The vast majority experienced none or only mild local injection reactions (88.0%â94.0% of patients, depending on the type of local injection reaction). Similar numbers were seen among CD and UC patients. Severe local symptoms were reported in only 1.2% of patients for the various subcategories. There was one case of drug discontinuation due to local injection reactions at 12Â months of followâup, but none during the first 6âmonths.\n",
      "In Sweden, the current fee for a visit to a registered nurse for administration of an IV infusion is approximately â¬290; the annual drug cost for IV vedolizumab (standard dosing) is approximately â¬13,700; and the annual drug cost for SC vedolizumab (standard dosing) is approximately â¬13,800. During IV vedolizumab treatment, 22.5% of patients required dose optimization (one infusion of 300âmg every 4â7âweeks or 600âmg every 8âweeks), and during SC vedolizumab treatment 10.1% were dose optimised to 108âmg of SC vedolizumab once weekly. Taking these factors into account, the annualised cost of maintenance treatment with SC vedolizumab was 15.0% lower than for maintenance treatment with IV vedolizumab.\n",
      "The phase III VISIBLE studies investigated de novo treatment with SC vedolizumab. However, studies on switching patients that are on established maintenance treatment with IV vedolizumab to SC treatment are largely lacking. We report on a switch from IV to SC vedolizumab maintenance treatment in 89 adult IBD patients in a realâworld setting with a followâup time of 6âmonths and for a subgroup 12Â months. Our results show that the levels of therapeutic efficacy, qualityâofâlife and adverse events were highly similar before as compared to after the switch with a high degree of drug persistence, and that the patients were in general very satisfied with being transferred to selfâadministered SC treatment.\n",
      "Faecal calprotectin levels showed a statistically significant decrease for the cohort as a whole and for CD patients, while levels remained unchanged for UC patients. However, absolute levels were low and the observed decreases may not be clinically relevant. On the other hand, subclinical changes in faecal calprotectin levels are considered to precede changes in clinical disease activity and decreases of this type may further stabilise a state of clinical remission. Drug persistence was high with 95.5% of patients remaining on treatment after 6âmonths, and 88.5% after 12Â months. These numbers are in line with those reported for IV vedolizumab treatment, ranging from 60â95% after 12Â months. \n",
      "Our evaluation of the outcome of the switch included thorough investigations of clinical disease activity, applying two activity indices for CD (patientâbased HBI and PRO2âCD) and two for UC (SCCAI and PRO2âUC), analysed by both median values and by proportions of patients in remission. All of these analyses corroborated the faecal calprotectin data, showing either unchanged disease activity levels after the switch in both CD and UC patients, or as in the case of SCCAI levels, a statistically significant improvement. For the 10 patients with perianal CD, the patientâbased HBI questionnaire was of particular interest since it included separate questions regarding active perianal fistula, perianal abscesses and anal fissures. At baseline, 3/10 had an active perianal disease but after the switch the number was 2/10 at followâup. From the literature, it seems that vedolizumab may have some therapeutic effect on perianal CD in a subset of patients, but that the effectiveness overall is moderate. Our results do not contradict this view, but one should be cautious regarding conclusions given the low number of patients with perianal CD.\n",
      "We also performed a subgroup analysis of patients with limited ileal CD, which showed measurable levels of faecal calprotectin with a numerical decrease after the switch. This confirms that faecal calprotectin was an adequate readout parameter also for this subset of CD patients, which has been debated but several recent studies have shown that faecal calprotectin is a sensitive measure of disease activity also in cases with limited ileal disease. \n",
      "The SC dose of 108âmg every 2âweeks was chosen by the manufacturer with the intent to provide patients with similar average serum concentrations at steady state, as the IV dose of 300âmg every 8âweeks. However, it is unclear whether average serum concentrations directly translate into levels of therapeutic efficacy. In addition, it is possible that the altered pharmacokinetics that comes with SC administration affect the various mechanisms of action of vedolizumab (i.e. those suggested to take place in the circulation compared to within tissues) in different ways. Although the VISIBLE studies gave us an indication as to what serum levels are common with SC vedolizumab at standard dose, the studies did not address which levels are therapeutically optimal. In our study, serum vedolizumab trough concentrations at steady state were approximately twice as high during SC as compared with IV treatment. These findings are in line with the VISIBLE studies and the study by Ventress et al. Our results suggest an inverse relationship between serum vedolizumab trough levels and faecal calprotectin levels with vedolizumab given IV. However, after 6âmonths with SC vedolizumab at standard dose, this correlation was not seen. This change was primarily observed in CD patients, which also displayed a statistically significant decrease in faecal calprotectin levels after having switched to SC treatment. Our subgroup analyses of patients that had been on optimised IV dosing did not show any signs of disease worsening in terms of remission rates, clinical index scores, biomarker levels or drug persistence, after the switch to standard SC dosing. Interestingly, patients on standard IV dosing showed a statistically significant improvement in faecal calprotectin levels on SC treatment, while other outcome measures remained unchanged. Taken together, these results suggest that some patients were underdosed when being on standard IV dosing and that they were more adequately dosed (or potentially overdosed at the group level) on SC standard dosing.\n",
      "Ventress et al. suggested that the first dose of SC vedolizumab should be given 28âdays after the last IV dose. This was based on the assumption that the serum drug concentrations observed in the VISIBLE studies are therapeutically the most appropriate (although this has not been studied) and that the drug levels should be kept at or above this limit. With IV vedolizumab, patients' drug levels are below this limit during the entire second half of the 8âweek dosing interval. There is no evidence that the limited time that serum concentrations are below the SC serum steadyâstate levels in the VISIBLE studies increases the risk of relapse, nor for doseâdependent toxicity, if the first SC dose is given in close proximity to the last IV dose. Thus, with current knowledge and with support from our data we would argue that the first SC dose may be administered when the next IV dose would have been given, or earlier due to potential practical aspects.\n",
      "In our cohort, the rates of adverse events were similar before and after the switch, and no serious adverse events were reported. Some of the reported symptoms, including fatigue, headache, nausea and arthralgia, were transient and lasted 1â2âdays after injection. The time to the maximum serum concentration after administration of vedolizumab subcutaneously is on average 7âdays with a variation between 3â14âdays. Such transient reactions are thus not likely to be an effect of the drug per se but more likely representing nonpharmacological potentially immuneâmediated adverse effects, alternatively representing a nocebo effect. Investigating local injection reactions, moderate discomfort, pain or burning sensations were reported by 5%â11% of patients, and corresponding severe reactions by 1% of the patients. Conversely, 88%â94% reported none or only mild local injection reactions. These results are in line with the VISIBLE studies as well as with data for other SC biologics. SC vedolizumab contains citrate which has been pointed out to be causing pain, but studies that have addressed this issue underscore that citrate is merely one of several factors that may affect potential pain sensation at SC injection and that some of the studies attributing pain at the injection site to citrate are difficult to interpret since citrate was one of several factors modified. Other factors that may be equally important in this context are other buffers commonly used such as phosphate and histidine, the buffer concentration, injected volume, solution temperature, pH, osmolality, needle gauge, injector device, injection speed, injection technique and low body weight. \n",
      "We also investigated various aspects of the patients' experience with the injector pen and the switch from IV to SC treatment. Overall patients found the injector pen to be userâfriendly and they were very satisfied with switching to SC treatment, which was reflected in all aspects explored. However, this dataset can also be used to illuminate the group of patients, albeit small (2%â9%), that preferred IV infusions. Thus, SC administration may not be the best option for all patients. One caveat with SC treatment is that it may be more difficult to ensure patient compliance. Hence, for patients where compliance historically has been a problem or if risk factors for nonâadherence are present, IV therapy may be advisable. \n",
      "Evaluations of healthârelated qualityâofâlife using the SHS instrument showed no statistically significant differences after the switch, but there was a slight numerical trend towards improved overall qualityâofâlife as well as better symptomârelated and social functionârelated qualityâofâlife in patients with CD. These findings underscore the high level of satisfaction regarding the switch.\n",
      "The annualised cost of SC vedolizumab maintenance treatment was calculated to be 15.0% lower than for IV maintenance treatment. Another structural benefit was that nurse resources were liberated for other work tasks. This was especially valuable in times of a pandemic when the number of nurses at the outpatient clinic had to be diminished to enable staffing of Covidâ19 wards. In addition, avoiding hospital visits in this context was desirable to prevent transmission of the virus.\n",
      "This study had some important limitations. Firstly, there was no control group that was continued on IV treatment. Secondly, patients were not evaluated endoscopically. Lastly, antiâdrug antibodies were not measured.\n",
      "In conclusion, this study shows that a switch from IV to SC vedolizumab maintenance treatment can be done with maintained efficacy, safety and tolerability, including in patients on optimised IV vedolizumab dosing. In addition, patient satisfaction regarding the switch was overall high, although for a small proportion of patients IV treatment may be advisable. The appropriate window for serum vedolizumab concentration to target for combined optimal efficacy, patient convenience and costâeffectiveness during SC maintenance treatment, is still unclear and should be addressed in future studies.\n",

',\n",
       " 'Vedolizumab is a humanised monoclonal IgG1 antibody that binds to Î±4Î²7 and inhibits the interaction with MAdCAMâ\\x80\\x901. This prevents Î±4Î²7â\\x80\\x90expressing immune cells from extravasating which leads to a decrease in local inflammatory activity. More recently, vedolizumab has been shown to modulate innate immunity, including macrophage and dendritic cell populations, in addition to adaptive immunity. The limited expression pattern of MAdCAMâ\\x80\\x901 is thought to account for vedolizumabâ\\x80\\x99s gutâ\\x80\\x90specific immunosuppressive effect which in turn translates into a beneficial safety profile.

Vedolizumab was originally developed for administration via intravenous (IV) infusions. Recently, a formulation for subcutaneous (SC) administration was approved for maintenance treatment following at least two IV infusions. This approval was based on the phase III trials VISIBLE 1 and VISIBLE 2 which evaluated SC vedolizumab treatment after two initial IV doses in CD and UC patients, respectively. The proportion of subjects in clinical remission 52 weeks after the start of treatment, which was the primary endpoint, was significantly higher in the SC vedolizumabâ\\x80\\x90treated group compared to the placebo group, in both trials. Median trough concentrations at steady state during SC vedolizumab were 30.2 and 34.6Â\\xa0Î¼g/ml for CD and UC patients, respectively, which was substantially higher than the median trough level during IV treatment presented in VISIBLE 1 (11.1Â\\xa0Î¼g/ml). In contrast, the average serum concentrations over time were rather similar (39.8 and 32.2Â\\xa0Î¼g/ml, during SC and IV treatment, respectively). Finally, there were no new safety issues observed, other than the incidence of injectionâ\\x80\\x90site reaction frequencies. However, data on patient experience or satisfaction were not presented in the VISIBLE publications, and studies to investigate the efficacy and safety of switching patients from maintenance IV to maintenance SC vedolizumab treatment in a realâ\\x80\\x90world setting are scarce. To our knowledge, there is only one report on the topic, and in that study, the followâ\\x80\\x90up time after the switch was only 12â\\x80\\x89weeks. Given that the halfâ\\x80\\x90life of the drug is approximately 26â\\x80\\x89days and that the washâ\\x80\\x90out period is several months, such a short followâ\\x80\\x90up time may not be adequate to examine the effectiveness of the SC formulation. Nevertheless, the authors described a 52% increase (pâ\\x80\\x89<â\\x80\\x890.01) in the patients' faecal calprotectin levels at the end of their study which was rather unexpected.

In addition, it is possible that the altered pharmacokinetics that comes with SC administration affect the various mechanisms of action of vedolizumab (i.e. those suggested to take place in the circulation compared to within tissues) in different ways. Although the VISIBLE studies gave us an indication as to what serum levels are common with SC vedolizumab at standard dose, the studies did not address which levels are therapeutically optimal. In our study, serum vedolizumab trough concentrations at steady state were approximately twice as high during SC as compared with IV treatment. These findings are in line with the VISIBLE studies and the study by Ventress et al. Our results suggest an inverse relationship between serum vedolizumab trough levels and faecal calprotectin levels with vedolizumab given IV. However, after 6â\\x80\\x89months with SC vedolizumab at standard dose, this correlation was not seen. This change was primarily observed in CD patients, which also displayed a statistically significant decrease in faecal calprotectin levels after having switched to SC treatment. Our subgroup analyses of patients that had been on optimised IV dosing did not show any signs of disease worsening in terms of remission rates, clinical index scores, biomarker levels or drug persistence, after the switch to standard SC dosing. Interestingly, patients on standard IV dosing showed a statistically significant improvement in faecal calprotectin levels on SC treatment, while other outcome measures remained unchanged. Taken together, these results suggest that some patients were underdosed when being on standard IV dosing and that they were more adequately dosed (or potentially overdosed at the group level) on SC standard dosing.',\n",
       " \"Ventress et al. suggested that the first dose of SC vedolizumab should be given 28â\\x80\\x89days after the last IV dose. This was based on the assumption that the serum drug concentrations observed in the VISIBLE studies are therapeutically the most appropriate (although this has not been studied) and that the drug levels should be kept at or above this limit. With IV vedolizumab, patients' drug levels are below this limit during the entire second half of the 8â\\x80\\x90week dosing interval. There is no evidence that the limited time that serum concentrations are below the SC serum steadyâ\\x80\\x90state levels in the VISIBLE studies increases the risk of relapse, nor for doseâ\\x80\\x90dependent toxicity, if the first SC dose is given in close proximity to the last IV dose.

The time to the maximum serum concentration after administration of vedolizumab subcutaneously is on average 7â\\x80\\x89days with a variation between 3â\\x80\\x9314â\\x80\\x89days. Such transient reactions are thus not likely to be an effect of the drug per se but more likely representing nonpharmacological potentially immuneâ\\x80\\x90mediated adverse effects, alternatively representing a nocebo effect. Investigating local injection reactions, moderate discomfort, pain or burning sensations were reported by 5%â\\x80\\x9311% of patients, and corresponding severe reactions by 1% of the patients. Conversely, 88%â\\x80\\x9394% reported none or only mild local injection reactions. These results are in line with the VISIBLE studies as well as with data for other SC biologics. SC vedolizumab contains citrate which has been pointed out to be causing pain, but studies that have addressed this issue underscore that citrate is merely one of several factors that may affect potential pain sensation at SC injection and that some of the studies attributing pain at the injection site to citrate are difficult to interpret since citrate was one of several factors modified. Other factors that may be equally important in this context are other buffers commonly used such as phosphate and histidine, the buffer concentration, injected volume, solution temperature, pH, osmolality, needle gauge, injector device, injection speed, injection technique and low body weight.

       " \"We also investigated various aspects of the patients' experience with the injector pen and the switch from IV to SC treatment. Overall patients found the injector pen to be userâ\\x80\\x90friendly and they were very satisfied with switching to SC treatment, which was reflected in all aspects explored. However, this dataset can also be used to illuminate the group of patients, albeit small (2%â\\x80\\x939%), that preferred IV infusions. Thus, SC administration may not be the best option for all patients. One caveat with SC treatment is that it may be more difficult to ensure patient compliance. Hence, for patients where compliance historically has been a problem or if risk factors for nonâ\\x80\\x90adherence are present, IV therapy may be advisable. \",\n",
       " 'Evaluations of healthâ\\x80\\x90related qualityâ\\x80\\x90ofâ\\x80\\x90life using the SHS instrument showed no statistically significant differences after the switch, but there was a slight numerical trend towards improved overall qualityâ\\x80\\x90ofâ\\x80\\x90life as well as better symptomâ\\x80\\x90related and social functionâ\\x80\\x90related qualityâ\\x80\\x90ofâ\\x80\\x90life in patients with CD. These findings underscore the high level of satisfaction regarding the switch.',\n",
       " 'The annualised cost of SC vedolizumab maintenance treatment was calculated to be 15.0% lower than for IV maintenance treatment. Another structural benefit was that nurse resources were liberated for other work tasks. This was especially valuable in times of a pandemic when the number of nurses at the outpatient clinic had to be diminished to enable staffing of Covidâ\\x80\\x9019 wards. In addition, avoiding hospital visits in this context was desirable to prevent transmission of the virus.',\n",
       " 'This study had some important limitations. Firstly, there was no control group that was continued on IV treatment. Secondly, patients were not evaluated endoscopically. Lastly, antiâ\\x80\\x90drug antibodies were not measured.',\n",
       " 'In conclusion, this study shows that a switch from IV to SC vedolizumab maintenance treatment can be done with maintained efficacy, safety and tolerability, including in patients on optimised IV vedolizumab dosing. In addition, patient satisfaction regarding the switch was overall high, although for a small proportion of patients IV treatment may be advisable. The appropriate window for serum vedolizumab concentration to target for combined optimal efficacy, patient convenience and costâ\\x80\\x90effectiveness during SC maintenance treatment, is still unclear and should be addressed in future studies.',\n",
