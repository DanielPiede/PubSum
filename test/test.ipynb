       "    'fulltext': 'Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) is a heterogeneous group of chronic inflammatory disorders that mainly affects the gastrointestinal tract, of which the principal phenotypes are Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Several biological treatment options are available. Tumour necrosis factor-α inhibitors (TNFis), such as infliximab and adalimumab, were the first class of biological agents approved for the treatment of patients with IBD and are highly effective against luminal and extra-intestinal manifestations of the disease. Anti-integrin agents (e.g., vedolizumab and natalizumab—only in the United States) are the second class of biological agents that have proven effective in both IBD entities.\\nTreatment guidelines for CD recommend TNFis for patients who have not responded to conventional therapy (e.g., steroids and/or thiopurines), whereas vedolizumab and ustekinumab, anti-interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-23, are recommended for patients who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy and/or TNFis. The use of TNFi therapy early in the disease course (in the first 2\\xa0years) may be more effective in CD and could be particularly beneficial in patients with poor prognostic factors (e.g., in patients with fistulising perianal disease). Guidelines for UC recommend treatment escalation with thiopurines, TNFi therapy, vedolizumab, ustekinumab or tofacitinib for patients receiving high dose mesalazine maintenance therapy who become corticosteroid dependent or refractory. In the case of TNFi treatment failure, second-line therapy with vedolizumab, ustekinumab or tofacitinib should be considered. US guidelines are broadly aligned with European guidelines with respect to appropriate biological therapies for patients with moderate-to-severe IBD.\\nGuidelines recommend that the choice of first-line biological agent should be determined by clinical factors, cost, safety, availability of local infusion capacity, as well as patient preference and likely adherence; however, there is limited evidence regarding the comparative efficacy and safety of these agents for the treatment of these patient populations. No head-to-head RCTs have compared infliximab and vedolizumab for the treatment of patients with IBD, and comparative data from real-world studies are difficult to contextualise in the absence of mutually supplementary RCTs.\\nSeveral systematic reviews have synthesised data for multiple biological agents (including infliximab and vedolizumab) in IBD to draw preliminary conclusions; however, one did not evaluate the relative safety of infliximab and vedolizumab, and the other covered only the induction phase in patients with UC. Furthermore, existing systematic reviews do not include data from more recent pivotal trials (e.g., of subcutaneous [SC] infliximab). Therefore, to our knowledge, we have conducted the first systematic review and meta-analysis to comprehensively evaluate the comparative efficacy and safety of infliximab and vedolizumab in adult patients with moderate-to-severe CD or UC.\\nThe current systematic review was performed using a pre-established protocol. (PROSPERO number: CRD42021177954).\\nWe performed systematic electronic searches of PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane Library (comprising the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the Health Technology Assessment database). Search strategies were developed using Medical Subject Headings and free-text terms (Supplementary materials). All searches were performed for the period of 1 January 2010 through 30 April 2021 to ensure the inclusion of recently published data.\\nParallel-group RCTs were included for the analysis.\\nTwo cohorts of patients (analysed separately) were included: adults (aged\\u2009≥\\u200918\\xa0years) with moderate-to-severe CD or adults (aged\\u2009≥\\u200918\\xa0years) with moderate-to-severe UC. Patients with unspecified disease severity or those who had undergone intestinal surgery were excluded.\\nWe included trials that evaluated infliximab (reference product or biosimilar) or vedolizumab. Dosing regimens were required to align with the summary of product characteristics (SmPC) for approved drugs, or with the SmPC of the originator product for unapproved biosimilars.\\nStudies that reported one or more of the following outcomes at Week 6 (induction phase) and/or at 1\\xa0year (Weeks 50–54; maintenance phase) were included. Efficacy outcomes for CD included the proportion of patients achieving a Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (CDAI)-70 response, defined as a 70\\u2009≥\\u2009points decrease from the baseline value, proportion of patients achieving a CDAI-100 response (a decrease in CDAI score of\\u2009≥\\u2009100 points from the baseline value) and proportion of patients achieving clinical remission (an absolute CDAI score of\\u2009<\\u2009150 points). Efficacy outcomes for UC included the proportion of patients achieving clinical response (defined as a decrease from baseline in total Mayo score of\\u2009≥\\u20093 points and\\u2009≥\\u200930%, with an accompanying decrease in rectal bleeding subscore of\\u2009≥\\u20091 point or an absolute rectal bleeding subscore of 0 or 1), proportion of patients achieving clinical remission (a total Mayo score of\\u2009≤\\u20092 points with no individual subscore exceeding 1 point) and proportion of patients achieving mucosal healing (an absolute endoscopic subscore of 0 or 1 per the Mayo Scoring System). Safety outcomes (CD and UC) included the proportions of patients experiencing any adverse event (AE), serious adverse event (SAE), any infection or serious infection, and the proportion who discontinued due to AEs or lack of efficacy that are evaluated at any point of time in a year.\\nTwo investigators (HGB, MJ) independently screened the titles and abstracts of the retrieved records (per eligibility criteria in Sect.\\xa02.2) to exclude studies that are irrelevant to the research question. A third reviewer (Taek Sang Kwon, Celltrion Healthcare) mediated in the points of disagreement. The third reviewer randomly selected sample of excluded studies to validate appropriate application of the exclusion criteria.\\nFull-text articles of studies identified as potentially relevant for inclusion during title and abstract screening were reviewed independently by two authors HGB and MJ to determine inclusion (recording reasons), and the third reviewer arbitrated in the case of disagreement. Multiple reports of the same study were collected so that studies were the unit of interest for the review. The screening and full-text review process was thoroughly documented to complete a Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) flow diagram.\\nStudy characteristics and outcome data were extracted from the included studies and recorded using a Microsoft Excel template (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA, USA). The following study characteristics were extracted: design (study duration, randomisation method, blinding), population (demographics, baseline disease activity, number of randomised participants, prior TNFi use, concomitant medication), interventions (type, dose, regimen), and prespecified outcome measures (see above 2.2.4; Additional file 1: Table 1).\\nData for each prespecified outcome of interest were pooled in two separate analyses for patients with CD or UC, respectively. Outcomes reported as proportions (n: event; N: population) were analysed, and the overall proportions from each study were combined using a random-effects meta-analysis. A meta-analysis was only performed if studies were deemed to have similar characteristics (e.g., study populations and treatments). The I2 statistic was used to evaluate heterogeneity among the trials included in each meta-analysis. All statistical analyses were performed using R (version 4.0.2).\\nRisk of bias and generalisability for the included studies were evaluated according to criteria defined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. The following domains were utilised in order to assess the risk of bias: random sequence generation; allocation concealment; blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment; incomplete outcome data; selective outcome reporting; and other bias. Each potential source of bias was rated as high, low, or unclear. Assessments were completed by an author (HGB) responsible for data extraction and checked by a second author (MJ).\\nInfliximab (four studies): NCT00094458 (SONIC), NCT02096861 (PLANET CD), NCT02148640 (NOR-SWITCH), NCT02883452 (CT-P13 SC trial).\\nVedolizumab (two studies): NCT00783692 (GEMINI 2), NCT01224171 (GEMINI 3).\\nThe selection of studies for inclusion is summarised in a PRISMA flow diagram to illustrate the flow of information for studies enrolling patients with CD (Fig.\\xa01A). We identified 2,661 records through the searches. After removal of duplicates, 2,019 records were screened (1,855 records excluded) and 164 full-text articles were assessed against the eligibility criteria (150 articles excluded). Six studies (reported in 13 articles) were included in the qualitative synthesis and in the quantitative synthesis, as follows:\\nInfliximab (four studies): NCT00036439 (ACT1), NCT00096655 (ACT2), NCT02148640 (NOR-SWITCH), NCT02883452 (CT-P13 SC trial).\\nVedolizumab (three studies): NCT00783718 (GEMINI 1), NCT02497469 (VARSITY), NCT02611830 (VISIBLE 1).\\nA PRISMA flow diagram summarising the flow of information for studies enrolling patients with UC is presented in Fig.\\xa01B. We identified 1,959 records through the electronic searches and one record from another source. Specifically, as data for ACT 1 and 2 study by Adedokun et al. (2018) was not utilizable in our analysis because the article did not evaluate the prespecified timeframe and outcomes of our interest. The current review evaluated ACT 1 and 2 data as more data were needed for UC in order to perform meta-analyses in some outcomes (Fig.\\xa02A, Additional file 1: Figs.\\xa011, 12, 18), largely accounting for the fact that infliximab had few available RCT data for the past decade. Thus, we instead have taken data from the reference list of the article as an exception. After removal of duplicates, 1,138 records were screened (894 articles excluded) and 244 full-text articles were assessed against the eligibility criteria (232 articles excluded). Seven studies (reported in 12 articles) were included in the qualitative synthesis and quantitative analyses, as follows:\\nThe design and eligibility criteria of the six studies that contributed data to the CD analyses were generally consistent (Additional file 1: Table 1). All six studies were randomised trials with a duration of\\u2009≥\\u200950\\xa0weeks: five studies included a double-blind period, and one study was conducted using an open-label design (CT-P13 SC trial). Two of the six studies included an open-label extension (NOR-SWITCH and GEMINI\\xa03) and three studies (PLANET CD, NOR-SWITCH and CT-P13) included switching phases wherein participants switched between infliximab products. Five of six studies were multinational, whereas one study was conducted in Norway (NOR-SWITCH).\\nAcross studies, inclusion criteria required participants to be adults (aged\\u2009≥\\u200918) with a diagnosis of CD; four of six studies required participants to have a CDAI score of 220–450, one study (GEMINI 3) specified 220–400 and another (NOR-SWITCH) did not specify a CDAI score. Prior TNFi use was not permitted in three studies (SONIC, PLANET CD, CT-P13 SC trial), stable treatment with infliximab for\\u2009≥\\u20096\\xa0months was an inclusion criterion in NOR-SWITCH, and treatment failure with corticosteroids, immunosuppressive agents or TNFis was an inclusion criterion for GEMINI 2 and GEMINI 3 (within the past 5\\xa0years).\\nAll studies included a treatment arm of either infliximab or vedolizumab. An intravenous formulation of infliximab or vedolizumab was initially administered at Weeks 0, 2, and 6 for induction and every 8\\xa0weeks (Q8W) thereafter while a subcutaneous formulation of infliximab was initially administered at Weeks 0 and 2 for induction and every 2\\xa0weeks (Q2W) from Week 6.\\nA total of 2,020 participants were initially randomised/assigned to relevant treatment arms of the selected studies. The mean/median age ranged from 32.0 to 39.5\\xa0years, 39% to 56% of participants were female, mean/median body weight ranged from 66.1 to 72.0\\xa0kg (where reported) and mean/median disease duration ranged from 2.2 to 14.3\\xa0years (Additional file 1: Table\\xa02).\\nThe design and eligibility criteria of the seven studies that contributed data to the UC analyses were generally consistent (Additional file 1: Table 1). All seven studies were randomised trials with a duration of\\u2009≥\\u200946\\xa0weeks, except for ACT2 (22\\xa0weeks): six studies included double-blind periods and one study was open-label (CT-P13 SC trial). Two studies included an open-label extension (NOR-SWITCH and VISIBLE 1). Three studies included switching phases wherein participants switched between infliximab products (NOR-SWITCH and CT-P13 SC trial) or between IV and SC vedolizumab (VISIBLE 1). Six of the seven studies were multinational, whereas one study (NOR-SWITCH) was conducted in Norway.\\nAcross studies, inclusion criteria required participants to be adults (aged\\u2009≥\\u200918\\xa0years) with active UC (Mayo score 6–12 and endoscopic sub-score\\u2009≥\\u20092) despite treatment with conventional therapies (e.g., corticosteroids, azathioprine or mercaptopurine). Prior TNFi treatment was not permitted in four studies (ACT 1, ACT 2, CT-P13 SC trial and VARSITY), stable treatment with infliximab for\\u2009≥\\u20096\\xa0months was an inclusion criterion in NOR-SWITCH and use of TNFi and biological agents were not permitted within 60\\xa0days before study initiation in GEMINI 1 and VISIBLE 1, respectively.\\nFour of the seven studies evaluated infliximab (ACT\\xa01, ACT 2, NOR-SWITCH and CT-P13 SC trial) and three evaluated vedolizumab (GEMINI 1, VISIBLE 1 and VARSITY). All of the infliximab studies included a treatment arm wherein infliximab was administered at Weeks 0, 2 and 6 (induction) and Q8W thereafter (maintenance) except for the CT-P13 SC trial. The CT-P13 SC trial included evaluation of subcutaneous infliximab Q2W from Week 6 following IV induction at Weeks 0 and 2 (see Sect.\\xa03.2.1). All of the vedolizumab studies included a treatment arm wherein IV vedolizumab was administered at Weeks 0, 2, and 6 and Q8W thereafter except for one study that included a treatment arm wherein IV vedolizumab was administered at Weeks 0 and 2 for induction, followed by SC vedolizumab Q2W from Week 6.\\nA total of 1,999 participants were initially randomised to relevant treatment arms of the included studies. The mean/median age ranged from 33.0 to 45.8\\xa0years, 30% to 46% of participants were female, mean/median body weight ranged from 66.1 to 80.0\\xa0kg (where reported) and mean/median disease duration ranged from 5.7 to 11.5\\xa0years (Additional file 1: Table\\xa03).\\nA summary of the risk-of-bias assessment for studies contributing to the CD analyses is presented in Fig.\\xa03A. Across 42 assessments (six studies and seven risk-of-bias domains), 29 were considered to be at low risk of bias, 10 at high risk and three to have an unclear risk of bias. All six studies had low risk of bias for random sequence generation and selective reporting. NOR-SWITCH was the only study considered at low or unclear risk of bias for all domains. Most studies (five out of six) had one or more domains considered to be at high risk, and the CT-P13 SC and GEMINI 2 trials were at high risk of bias for three and four domains, respectively. The CT-P13 SC study was considered to be at high risk of bias due to the nature of an open-label trial and the results were combined as inflammatory bowel disease, not categorized into CD and UC. GEMINI 2, NOR-SWITCH, and PLANET CD were considered to be at high risk of ‘other bias’ because of the selective inclusion of induction responders in the maintenance phase; notably, this high risk of bias applies only to the maintenance-phase data for these studies as the induction phase included all enrolled patients.\\nFigure\\xa03B presents a summary of the risk-of-bias assessment for studies contributing to the UC analyses. Across 49 assessments (seven studies and seven risk-of-bias domains), 36 were considered to be at low risk of bias, nine at high risk and four to have an unclear risk of bias. All seven studies were considered to be at low risk of bias for random sequence generation and selective reporting. Four studies were considered at low or unclear risk of bias for all domains (VARSITY, ACT\\xa01, ACT 2, NOR-SWITCH). Three studies had three domains considered to be at high risk of bias (GEMINI 1, VISIBLE 1, CT-P13 SC trial). The results from CT-P13 SC trial have the same risk of bias as CD such as having an open-label study design and did not fully categorised the safety outcomes. GEMINI 1 and VISIBLE 1 were considered to be at high risk of ‘other bias’ because of the selective inclusion of induction responders in the maintenance phase; again, this high risk of bias applies only to the maintenance-phase data for these studies as the induction phase included all enrolled patients.\\nA summary of findings for the meta-analyses for infliximab and vedolizumab in patients with CD is presented in Table 1. For most efficacy outcomes during the induction and maintenance phases, infliximab yielded better efficacy than vedolizumab, with non-overlapping 95% confidence intervals (CIs) (Fig.\\xa04A). During the induction phase, pooled results for efficacy outcomes in patients with CD showed that a higher proportion of patients treated with infliximab achieved a CDAI-70 response, CDAI-100 response or clinical remission with non-overlapping 95% CIs, in comparison with patients treated with vedolizumab (Fig.\\xa05A, Additional file 1: Figs.\\xa01–2). In the maintenance phase, a CDAI-70 response was not reported for vedolizumab, so only the data for infliximab is presented (Additional file 1: Fig.\\xa03); a numerical advantage with overlapping 95% CIs was observed with infliximab over vedolizumab for CDAI-100 and clinical remission (Fig.\\xa05B, Additional file 1: Figs.\\xa04). Pooled results for safety outcomes (Fig.\\xa06A; Additional file 1: Figs.\\xa05–10) showed that the proportions of patients experiencing AEs, SAEs, or who discontinued due to AEs were similar in infliximab- and vedolizumab-treated patients. A higher rate of infection was reported with infliximab; however, when it comes to serious infections, similar rates between infliximab and vedolizumab are observed. Six percent of patients treated with infliximab discontinued because the treatment was ineffective (Additional file 1: Fig.\\xa010) while one study was available for vedolizumab, where almost one-third of patients (37.7%) discontinued vedolizumab treatment due to lack of efficacy in the maintenance phase.\\nThe findings for the meta-analyses for infliximab and vedolizumab in patients with UC are presented in Figs.\\xa04B and 6B (Additional file 1: Figs.\\xa011–20), with a summary presented in Table 2. Pooled results for efficacy outcomes in patients with UC showed that in the induction phase, a higher proportion of patients treated with infliximab achieved a clinical response or clinical remission with non-overlapping 95% CIs, compared with patients treated with vedolizumab (Fig.\\xa02A, Additional file 1: Fig.\\xa011). In the maintenance phase, similar proportions of patients treated with infliximab or vedolizumab achieved a clinical response, clinical remission or mucosal healing, with overlapping 95% CIs (Fig.\\xa02B; Additional file 1: Figs.\\xa013–14). Pooled results for safety outcomes showed that the proportions of patients experiencing AEs or infections, or who discontinued due to AEs, were similar in the infliximab and vedolizumab groups (Fig.\\xa06B; Additional file 1: Figs.\\xa015–20); rates of SAEs and serious infections were also similar with overlapping 95% CIs. Fourteen percent of patients with vedolizumab discontinued due to lack of efficacy (Additional file 1: Fig.\\xa020); no available was available for infliximab.\\nThe present study is the first systematic review to compare the efficacy and safety of infliximab and vedolizumab in adult patients with moderate-to-severe CD or moderate-to-severe UC in order to address a lack of evidence of a direct comparison between the treatments. Data were extracted and pooled for the prespecified outcomes of interest at the corresponding 6-week and/or 50- to 54-week timepoints, respectively. Notably, the present evidence synthesis is the first to our knowledge to incorporate data for CT-P13 SC, an SC formulation of the infliximab.\\nOur results show that infliximab yielded better efficacy than vedolizumab for all the efficacy outcomes in patients with CD or UC during the induction phase, and comparable clinical efficacies with overlapping 95% CI in both diseases during the maintenance phase. The safety profiles of infliximab and vedolizumab in both cohorts were generally similar in terms of the proportions of patients experiencing AEs, SAEs, infection, and serious infection, as well as the rates of discontinuations due to AEs in the analysed study period.\\nBased on the demographics and clinical characteristics of the study populations contributing to the review, the present findings are applicable to patients with moderate-to-severe CD or UC and support the use of infliximab as a first-line biologic in these populations, per guideline recommendations. The quality of the evidence was broadly considered to be moderate to high on the guidelines. Prespecified outcomes of interest were well reported in the included studies, and meta-analyses included\\u2009≥\\u2009200 patients for the majority of outcomes evaluated.\\nRisk of bias in the included studies was principally considered to be low or was unclear (i.e. due to a lack of necessary information in the study reports). However, several studies were considered to be at high risk of ‘other bias’. Notably, the GEMINI 1, GEMINI\\xa02, VISIBLE 1, and PLANETCD studies were considered to be at high risk of bias on the basis of only including patients in the maintenance phase if they had responded during the induction phase (i.e. at 6\\xa0weeks). This practice may potentially lead to overestimation of efficacy in the maintenance phase and overall safety, compared with studies in which both responders and non-responders were included in the maintenance phase. Therefore, the data relating to non-responders’ efficacy in infliximab (NOR-SWITCH and PLANETCD) and vedolizumab (GEMINI 1, GEMINI 2, and VISIBLE 1) during maintenance phase may not be generalized. Future studies should address the limitation of selectively progressing responders to the maintenance period, to permit transparent comparability of biological agents available for the treatment of IBD.\\nThe level of heterogeneity observed within the meta-analyses was generally high, with I2 values exceeding 60% in a number of instances. This was likely influenced by the inclusion of studies with heterogeneous populations (e.g., TNFi-naïve patients and patients who had not responded adequately to prior TNFi therapy), as evidenced by the broad range of median disease durations reported across studies. It was not possible to conduct sensitivity analyses to address the source of heterogeneity due to small amount of available data. Likewise, the head-to-head trial is in need to address biases among the population and different study designs.\\nSeveral systematic reviews have examined the efficacy and/or safety of infliximab and vedolizumab in IBD. Our results confirm a prior comparative effectiveness and safety study in CD. A study by Singh et al. (2018) concluded that infliximab was ranked highest among biological therapies for induction and maintenance of clinical remission. When comparing infliximab and vedolizumab in TNF-naïve patients, infliximab yielded significantly better clinical response rates during the induction phase (Odds ratio (OR) 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.08 [0.02\\u2009−\\u20090.36]) and numerical advantages in clinical remission rates during both induction and maintenance phases (OR [95% CI]: induction 0.46 [0.16\\u2009−\\u20091.26], maintenance 0.81 [0.39\\u2009−\\u20091.67]). Consistent with these findings, the present study demonstrated the similar patterns of outcomes even when we included the most recent data from infliximab and vedolizumab studies (i.e., VISIBLE, VARSITY, the CT-P13 SC trial).\\nIn UC, two network meta-analyses and one meta-analysis were conducted. The most recent network meta-analysis by Zhou et al. (2021) found no significant difference between vedolizumab and infliximab on clinical response. Zhou and colleagues also found no difference between the treatments in clinical remission rates during induction phase, while Singh et al. reported a better clinical remission rate of infliximab in biologic-naïve patients (OR [95% CI]: clinical remission 0.62 [0.34\\u2009−\\u20091.15]). The present study is in line with the clinical remission results of the past studies.\\nAccording to Zhou, endoscopic improvement rates were higher in infliximab compared to vedolizumab in biologic-naïve patients during induction therapy in UC (OR [95% CI]: 0.76 [0.42\\u2009−\\u20091.37]); however, research by Cholapranee et al. (2017) reported that vedolizumab had higher mucosal healing rates than infliximab in the induction phase (OR [95% CI]: 0.63 [0.29\\u2009−\\u20091.41]). Nevertheless, vedolizumab resulted in lower rates of mucosal healing compared to infliximab during the maintenance phase (OR [95% CI]: 1.17 [0.35–3.84]). The mucosal healing rates were numerically similar in the maintenance phase in the current study which disagrees to the prior meta-analyses. The reason for such a discrepancy may be due to the fact that the timeframe of our interest was different from the other studies.\\nConcerning the safety outcomes in patients with UC, Zhou and colleagues found that vedolizumab resulted in fewer occurrences of adverse events than infliximab (relative risk (RR): 0.79 [0.62\\u2009−\\u20090.94]). Although insignificant, the serious adverse events were lower in vedolizumab; and a lower risk of infections was found in infliximab during maintenance therapy (RR [95% CI]: serious adverse event 1.12 [0.58\\u2009−\\u20092.14], infection 0.80 [0.48\\u2009−\\u20091.34]). The results conform to our safety outcomes, but in the current study, the proportions of patients experiencing serious adverse event and serious infection were comparable between the treatments with overlapping 95% CIs.\\nNarula and colleagues reported a post-hoc analysis of three UC clinical trial programmes, to compare the efficacy of infliximab and vedolizumab in patients with moderate-to-severe biologic-naïve UC. Broadly in agreement with the findings of the present review, the authors reported higher 1-year rates of clinical remission (corticosteroid free) and endoscopic remission with infliximab in comparison with vedolizumab, although the agents appeared to have similar efficacy in clinical symptom improvement.\\nStrengths of the present review process include prospective registration of the protocol (as documented on PROSPERO, comprehensive electronic searches and assessment of the included studies for risk of bias using gold-standard methods. Potential limitations of the review process include that a study was incorporated from outside of the prespecified time limits (to replace a recent article reporting data from the ACT 1 and ACT 2 studies); only articles published from 2010 onwards were used to ensure inclusion of studies relevant to current treatment practices, although we note that clinical practice continually evolves. For example, more recently, higher 10\\xa0mg/kg doses of infliximab are used in severe cases of IBD, and trough levels are actively monitored. Such practices would tend to favour infliximab over vedolizumab, both in terms of observed efficacy and safety (e.g., monitoring of trough levels helps to reduce the risk of infusion reaction during induction phase and loss of response).\\nDuring the review process, we also noted that several studies were not registered, and results were thus untraceable, potentially leading to omission of some relevant data. Furthermore, some studies were excluded from the present review because the timepoints assessed did not match those prespecified in the review protocol. This omission of potentially valuable data highlights the need to standardise future study designs. The present review did not assess longer-term follow-up (i.e., beyond 1\\xa0year) despite a sustained response being important to patients. Longer-term follow-up in larger real-world cohorts may also be more relevant to analyse safety.\\nFinally, the included studies enrolled different proportions of patients with previous biological treatment failure (potentially accounting for between-study differences in efficacy and accounting for some of the observed heterogeneity). Different proportions of TNFi-experienced patients in vedolizumab treatment groups compared to infliximab treatment group, which consists of TNF-naïve patients only. For instance, taking the VARSITY trial into account exhibited different results for vedolizumab. The VARSITY trial is a head-to-head trial that compared the efficacy and safety between adalimumab and vedolizumab in TNF-naïve patients with UC. Higher clinical response and remission rates were achieved during induction on the VARSITY trial in comparison with GEMINI 1 (Fig.\\xa02A, Additional file 1: Fig.\\xa011). On the other hand, considerably lower rates of mucosal healing and clinical remission were found in the VARSITY trial compared with the VISIBLE and GEMINI 1 during the maintenance phase (Fig.\\xa02B, Additional file 1: Fig.\\xa014). Largely accounting for the fact that the VISIBLE and GEMINI 1 studies included Week 6 responders only to the maintenance phase, while the VARSITY trial included patients regardless of Week 6 responsiveness.\\nDespite limitations in the evidence, the present systematic review represents an up-to-date evaluation of data from RCTs of infliximab and vedolizumab in IBD, capturing important new data from recently published studies.\\nIndirect comparison of infliximab and vedolizumab based on RCT data for the treatment of patients with IBD demonstrated that infliximab has significantly better efficacy in the induction phase, and comparable efficacy during the maintenance phase. A comparable safety profile including serious adverse event and serious infection between infliximab and vedolizumab was found over a year.\\nAE\\nAdverse event\\nCD\\nCrohn’s disease\\nCDAI\\nCrohn’s disease activity index\\nCI\\nConfidence interval\\nIBD\\nInflammatory bowel disease\\nIV\\nIntravenous\\nPRISMA\\nPreferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses\\nQ2W\\nEvery 2\\xa0weeks\\nQ8W\\nEvery 8\\xa0weeks\\nRCT\\nRandomised controlled trial\\nSAE\\nSerious adverse event\\nSC\\nSubcutaneous\\nSmPC\\nSummary of product characteristics\\nTNFi\\nTumour necrosis factor-α inhibitor\\nUC\\nUlcerative colitis\\nThe study protocol, data collection, interpretation and manuscript writing were performed by HGB.

       "    'fulltext': \"The inflammatory process of Crohn’s disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC), which are the two main forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), is thought to be driven by the infiltration of dysregulated proinflammatory immune cells into the inflamed intestinal tissue. This infiltration is facilitated by the interaction between the integrin α4β7, which is expressed on several circulating immune cell subsets including previously activated T‐cells, and its counterreceptor Mucosal Addressin Cell Adhesion Molecule‐1 (MAdCAM‐1), which is selectively expressed on the endothelial cells of intestinal venules. \\nVedolizumab is a humanised monoclonal IgG1 antibody that binds to α4β7 and inhibits the interaction with MAdCAM‐1. This prevents α4β7‐expressing immune cells from extravasating which leads to a decrease in local inflammatory activity. More recently, vedolizumab has been shown to modulate innate immunity, including macrophage and dendritic cell populations, in addition to adaptive immunity. The limited expression pattern of MAdCAM‐1 is thought to account for vedolizumab’s gut‐specific immunosuppressive effect which in turn translates into a beneficial safety profile. \\nVedolizumab is approved for the treatment of patients with moderate‐to‐severe CD or UC, where treatment with conventional therapy or an anti‐TNF agent has failed. Vedolizumab was originally developed for administration via intravenous (IV) infusions. Recently, a formulation for subcutaneous (SC) administration was approved for maintenance treatment following at least two IV infusions. This approval was based on the phase III trials VISIBLE 1 and VISIBLE 2 which evaluated SC vedolizumab treatment after two initial IV doses in CD and UC patients, respectively. The proportion of subjects in clinical remission 52 weeks after the start of treatment, which was the primary endpoint, was significantly higher in the SC vedolizumab‐treated group compared to the placebo group, in both trials. Median trough concentrations at steady state during SC vedolizumab were 30.2 and 34.6\\xa0μg/ml for CD and UC patients, respectively, which was substantially higher than the median trough level during IV treatment presented in VISIBLE 1 (11.1\\xa0μg/ml). In contrast, the average serum concentrations over time were rather similar (39.8 and 32.2\\xa0μg/ml, during SC and IV treatment, respectively). Finally, there were no new safety issues observed, other than the incidence of injection‐site reaction frequencies. However, data on patient experience or satisfaction were not presented in the VISIBLE publications, and studies to investigate the efficacy and safety of switching patients from maintenance IV to maintenance SC vedolizumab treatment in a real‐world setting are scarce. To our knowledge, there is only one report on the topic, and in that study, the follow‐up time after the switch was only 12\\u2009weeks. Given that the half‐life of the drug is approximately 26\\u2009days and that the wash‐out period is several months, such a short follow‐up time may not be adequate to examine the effectiveness of the SC formulation. Nevertheless, the authors described a 52% increase (p\\u2009<\\u20090.01) in the patients' faecal calprotectin levels at the end of their study which was rather unexpected. Thus, further studies are warranted.\\nThere are several potential benefits with SC as compared to IV administration of vedolizumab including a reduced burden of health care resources and increased patient convenience. Potential caveats with SC treatment are increased difficulties to ensure therapy compliance, fewer built‐in disease follow‐up visits, possible IV treatment preference and local skin reactions to SC injections.\\nThe aims of this study were to assess efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics, patient experience, patient satisfaction, and potential cost savings following a switch from IV to SC vedolizumab treatment in patients with inflammatory bowel disease in a real‐world setting.\\nThis was a prospective observational cohort study of a switch from maintenance IV to SC vedolizumab treatment in a population of adult IBD patients. The study was conducted at the Skane University Hospital, Sweden, with a 6‐month follow‐up period. Consecutive patients were approached regarding participation. Inclusion criteria comprised signed informed consent; diagnosis of CD, UC or IBD‐unclassified; and ongoing maintenance treatment with IV vedolizumab (previously received ≥3 doses of IV vedolizumab). Exclusion criteria comprised noticeable difficulties handling an SC injector pen, inability to give informed consent, or inability to comply with study procedures. The study was performed in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Ethical permission was granted by the regional research ethics committee in Lund, Sweden (DNR 2018/761). All patients provided written informed consent to participation before study entry.\\nPatients were enrolled between December 2020 and June 2021. The study included a baseline visit, scheduled at the time‐point when the patient should have received the next dose of IV vedolizumab, and a follow‐up visit 6\\u2009months after the switch. A subset of patients, that was the first to be enrolled, could be evaluated also after 12\\xa0months. Additional visits were scheduled on demand in case of a suspected disease flare or potential side effects. All patients were switched to a dose of 108\\u2009mg vedolizumab SC every 2\\u2009weeks regardless of previous dose or dosing interval on IV vedolizumab. All conventional IBD treatments were permitted during the study and changes in the treatment regimen were allowed if clinically indicated. Dose optimization of SC vedolizumab to 108\\u2009mg weekly was done at the discretion of the treating physician based on a combination of clinical symptoms and biomarker levels. Any changes in treatment regimen throughout the study period were recorded.\\nBaseline data recorded included diagnosis (CD, UC or IBD‐unclassified), gender, age at diagnosis, age at inclusion, weight, height, smoking status, time on IV vedolizumab before the switch, IV vedolizumab dose and dosing interval at inclusion, previous and current IBD treatment, disease characteristics according to the Montreal classification, and disease activity at baseline.\\nThe primary endpoint was change in disease activity defined by faecal calprotectin levels at 6\\u2009months after the switch to SC vedolizumab treatment. Faecal calprotectin is a sensitive and non‐subjective measure of disease activity that is not affected by placebo or nocebo effects. It reacts to an early increase in subclinical inflammatory activity and is expected to change earlier than clinical symptom levels in the event of a diminished therapeutic effect.\\nSecondary endpoints were [all refer to 6\\u2009months of follow‐up unless otherwise indicated] (a) change in remission rates defined by a faecal calprotectin <150\\u2009μg/g and clinical disease activity indices: for CD patient‐based Harvey Bradshaw Index (HBI) ≤4 or Patient‐Reported Outcomes (PRO)2‐CD ≤11 and for UC Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index (SCCAI) ≤2 or PRO2‐UC\\xa0=\\xa00. PRO2 scores were applied in accordance with the STRIDE documents. Briefly, the PRO2‐CD is the sum of the daily soft or liquid stool frequency and abdominal pain (multiplied by the weighting factors 2 and 5, respectively) items from the Crohn’s Disease Activity Index, whereas the PRO2‐UC is the simple sum of the stool frequency and rectal bleeding items from the Mayo score; (b) change in the laboratory biomarker plasma C‐reactive protein (CRP); (c) change in clinical disease activity defined by the patient‐based HBI for CD and the SCCAI for UC, as well as symptom levels according to the Patient‐Reported Outcomes (PRO)‐2 criteria as described in the STRIDE documents; (d) subgroup analyses of patients that were dose optimised on IV vedolizumab, and patients with perianal CD, respectively; (e) subgroup analysis of patients that completed 12\\xa0months of follow‐up, including drug persistence (11 patients that had not completed 12\\xa0months of follow‐up but remained on the drug were censored), and evaluation of faecal calprotectin and plasma CRP levels. When all patients had completed the first 6\\u2009months of follow‐up, the study was closed and thus not all patients completed 12\\xa0months of follow‐up; (f) adverse events and local injection reactions; (g) serum vedolizumab trough levels and relation to faecal calprotectin levels (patients categorised into quartiles based on serum vedolizumab trough levels and median faecal calprotectin levels calculated per quartile), and SC vedolizumab dose optimization rates; (h) patient experience of switching from IV to SC treatment, overall injection experience and patient satisfaction with various aspects of the injector pen [see below for details]; (i) health‐related quality‐of‐life using the Short Health Scale (SHS) which is a validated four‐item questionnaire (symptom burden, social function, disease‐related worry and general well‐being; each item scored 0–5 with an SHS composite score ranging from 0 to 20) and (j) annualised cost savings per patient with SC as compared to IV treatment.\\nFaecal calprotectin levels were analysed using an enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; PhiCal, Calpro AS). Serum vedolizumab trough levels were analysed by a Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) validated in‐house developed chemiluminescence ELISA at the Karolinska Institute (Stockholm, Sweden). Both methods are used in clinical routine care and the analyses were performed in clinical laboratories.\\nAdverse events that occurred after study entry considered related or of possible relation to SC vedolizumab treatment or switch were documented. Local injection reactions including discomfort, pain, burning sensation and erythema; and patient satisfaction with the injector pen, overall injection experience, the experience of switching from IV to SC treatment; were evaluated using structured questionnaires (see Table\\xa01 and Table\\xa0S1 for details on items, questions asked and response options). The questions and response options were adapted from previously published questionnaires used in similar studies. \\nAnnualised treatment costs for IV treatment included the cost of an appointment with a nurse for drug administration and the cost of the drug. Treatment costs of SC treatment included annual drug costs only. The rates of patients that were dose escalated on IV and SC treatment, respectively, were accounted for in the calculation.\\nData are presented as mean values with standard deviation (SD), or median values with interquartile range (IQR) as appropriate. Prism 9 for Mac OS X version 9.3.1 (GraphPad Software, Inc.) was used for statistical analyses and to graph data. The paired‐samples Student’s t‐test alternatively the Wilcoxon matched‐pair signed‐rank test was used to compare baseline and follow‐up data for changes in laboratory biomarkers, disease activity indices and quality‐of‐life scores as appropriate depending on data scale type and data distribution. Missing data are shown by presenting numbers of data points in the figures. The complete case analysis method was applied, which together with an account of discontinued patients and data point numbers presented, was deemed to give the most adequate description of the cohort. The approach was verified by performing sensitivity analyses comprising best‐ and worst‐case scenario calculations (i.e. missing data equals relapse and remission, respectively), neither of which altered the statistical significance as compared with the complete case analysis. Regarding faecal calprotectin‐missing data, the missing‐at‐random assumption is plausible and the complete case analysis is thus adequate to apply. The Kruskal–Wallis test was used to assess differences in faecal calprotectin levels between patient groups stratified by serum vedolizumab trough level quartiles during IV and SC vedolizumab treatment, respectively. The chi‐square test was used to compare remission rates between groups. Kaplan–Meier survival analysis was used to calculate drug persistence. A statistically significant test result was defined by p\\u2009<\\u20090.05.\\nEighty‐nine patients (48 patients with CD, 41 patients with UC and no patients with IBD‐unclassified) were included in the study. In total, 102 patients were approached regarding participation. Twelve patients declined participation, and one patient did not meet the inclusion criteria (Figure\\xa01). Baseline patient characteristics, clinical disease activity scores, laboratory biomarkers, concomitant IBD treatment and time on IV vedolizumab are presented in Table\\xa02. Details on previous IBD treatments and changes during follow‐up are presented in Table\\xa0S2. The median time on IV vedolizumab before the switch was 26.1\\u2009months (IQR 9.5–52.9). The wide IQR illustrates heterogeneity in terms of previous exposure time to vedolizumab. At baseline, four patients received low dose oral prednisolone (1.25–10\\xa0mg daily), and three patients received oral budesonide. Prednisolone could be discontinued in one of these patients. Results refer to 6 months follow‐up, unless otherwise specified.\\nFor the cohort as a whole and the subgroup of CD patients, significant decreases in faecal calprotectin median levels were observed following the switch, whereas no change was seen in UC patients (Figure\\xa02A). The remission rates as defined by faecal calprotectin remained stable for all three groups (Figure\\xa02B). A subgroup analysis of faecal calprotectin levels in patients with limited ileal CD showed a median of 145\\u2009μg/g (IQR 48–281) at baseline and 94\\u2009μg/g (IQR 50.0–175.5) at follow‐up. The corresponding values for the entire CD group were 64.0 (IQR 12.5–238.5) μg/g and 49.0\\xa0μg/g (IQR 12.5–161.8), respectively. Analyses of plasma CRP levels did not show any significant changes before compared with after switch for the cohort as a whole, nor in the CD and UC subgroups (data not shown).\\nClinical disease activity in patients with CD, as measured by average patient‐based HBI and PRO2‐CD scores, remained unchanged (Figure\\xa03A). Patients with UC displayed a statistically significant improvement in clinical symptoms according to the SCCAI although the median score remained unchanged, while the PRO2‐UC score did not show a significant change (Figure\\xa03C). There were no statistically significant changes in the proportions of patients displaying clinical remission, as defined by patient‐based HBI ≤4 or PRO2‐CD ≤11 for patients with CD, and by SCCAI ≤2 or PRO2‐UC\\xa0=\\xa00 for patients with UC (Figure\\xa03B,D).\\nAt baseline, 10 patients had a diagnosis of perianal CD. Three of these had active perianal disease at baseline, and at follow‐up, this number was two.\\nTwenty patients were on optimised IV vedolizumab dosing at baseline. At follow‐up, there was no significant change in their faecal calprotectin levels, whereas the 69 patients that had been on standard IV vedolizumab dosing showed a small but significant decrease (Figure\\xa04A). Faecal calprotectin remission rates (Figure\\xa04A) and plasma CRP median values (data not shown) remained unchanged in both groups. Clinical remission rates remained stable at follow‐up (Figure\\xa04B,C) except for the PRO2‐UC remission rate for UC patients that had been on standard IV vedolizumab dosing, where a statistically significant improvement was seen (Figure\\xa04C).\\nDose optimization of SC vedolizumab to 108\\u2009mg weekly was deemed indicated in 10.1% of patients (6 CD, 3 UC). Three of these (1 CD, 2 UC) belonged to the subgroup of 20 patients (22.5%) that had been on intensified IV vedolizumab dosing before the switch, whereas the other 17 (85%) remained on standard SC dosing. All patients with perianal CD (n\\xa0=\\xa010) remained on treatment, but 3/10 were dose optimised to SC vedolizumab 108\\u2009mg weekly. No patient required hospitalisation or IV corticosteroid treatment due to disease worsening during the study.\\nA subset of patients was evaluated at 12\\xa0months after the switch, in addition to the more comprehensive evaluation after the primary follow‐up period of 6\\u2009months. Drug persistence at 6 and 12\\xa0months were 95.5% (85/89) and 88.5% (69/78), respectively, for the whole cohort (Figure\\xa05). Reasons for drug discontinuation (n\\xa0=\\xa09) were disease worsening in five patients, change in treatment regimen due to extraintestinal manifestations (present before the switch) in one patient, local injection reaction in one patient and adverse events in two patients (headache and repeated infections). There were no statistically significant changes in plasma CRP levels for the whole cohort (n\\xa0=\\xa050), CD (n\\xa0=\\xa027) or UC (n\\xa0=\\xa023); or in faecal calprotectin levels for the whole cohort (n\\xa0=\\xa020), CD (n\\xa0=\\xa010) or UC (n\\xa0=\\xa010), at 12\\xa0months (data not shown).\\nMedian serum vedolizumab trough levels at steady state on IV treatment (i.e. at baseline) were 8.1\\xa0μg/ml (IQR 5.2–14\\u2009μg/ml) for the whole cohort, 8.7\\xa0μg/ml (IQR 4.9–14.0\\xa0μg/ml) in CD patients, and 7.9\\xa0μg/ml (IQR 5.3–12.5\\xa0μg/ml) in UC patients. Median serum vedolizumab trough levels at steady state on SC treatment (i.e. at 6\\u2009months follow‐up) were 19.0\\xa0μg/ml (IQR 13.0–23.0\\xa0μg/ml) for the whole cohort, 19.0\\xa0μg/ml (IQR 12.0–22.8\\xa0μg/ml) in CD patients, and 18.5\\xa0μg/ml (IQR 15.0–23.8\\xa0μg/ml) in UC patients. When patients were on IV treatment, we found significantly higher faecal calprotectin levels, primarily among CD patients, in the quartiles with the lowest serum vedolizumab trough levels compared to those with higher serum vedolizumab trough levels (Figure\\xa06A). This relationship was not observed after patients had been on SC treatment for 6\\xa0months (Figure\\xa06B).\\nWe observed no differences in the SHS composite score or separate SHS items (Figure\\xa0S1). Patient satisfaction with the injector pen (all eight categories; see Table\\xa0S1 for details) was high with 94.1%–100% of patients responding “strongly agree”, “agree” or “agree to some extent” (Figure\\xa07A). Overall satisfaction with the injection experience was generally high with 96.4% of the patients reporting being satisfied or very satisfied (Figure\\xa07B). Generally, patients favoured SC administration over IV (Figure\\xa07C). Only 2.4–9.4% of patients reported a slight preference for IV treatment over SC. Conversely, 55.3% of patients experienced SC treatment as slightly or clearly more effective, and 85.9% slightly or clearly more convenient (Figure\\xa07C). Regarding overall feeling of security, no preference was the most frequent response (58.8%) and a slight preference for IV treatment was reported by 9.4% of patients (Figure\\xa07C). Taking all aspects that follow with the given route of administration into account, 83.3% of patients reported a preference for SC over IV treatment, whereas the opposite was true for 2.4% of patients (Figure\\xa07C).\\nAll reported adverse events are presented in Table\\xa01. Adverse events, excluding local injection reactions, occurred in 15 (31.3%) of CD patients and 10 (24.4%) of UC patients. The corresponding rates for IV treatment were 27.1% and 22.0%, respectively. Some patients reported several side effects. The most common complaint was fatigue, followed by headache, nausea and rash. No serious adverse events were reported. Data on local skin reactions including discomfort, pain, burning sensation and erythema are presented in Table\\xa01. The vast majority experienced none or only mild local injection reactions (88.0%–94.0% of patients, depending on the type of local injection reaction). Similar numbers were seen among CD and UC patients. Severe local symptoms were reported in only 1.2% of patients for the various subcategories. There was one case of drug discontinuation due to local injection reactions at 12\\xa0months of follow‐up, but none during the first 6\\u2009months.\\nIn Sweden, the current fee for a visit to a registered nurse for administration of an IV infusion is approximately €290; the annual drug cost for IV vedolizumab (standard dosing) is approximately €13,700; and the annual drug cost for SC vedolizumab (standard dosing) is approximately €13,800. During IV vedolizumab treatment, 22.5% of patients required dose optimization (one infusion of 300\\u2009mg every 4–7\\u2009weeks or 600\\u2009mg every 8\\u2009weeks), and during SC vedolizumab treatment 10.1% were dose optimised to 108\\u2009mg of SC vedolizumab once weekly. Taking these factors into account, the annualised cost of maintenance treatment with SC vedolizumab was 15.0% lower than for maintenance treatment with IV vedolizumab.\\nThe phase III VISIBLE studies investigated de novo treatment with SC vedolizumab. However, studies on switching patients that are on established maintenance treatment with IV vedolizumab to SC treatment are largely lacking. We report on a switch from IV to SC vedolizumab maintenance treatment in 89 adult IBD patients in a real‐world setting with a follow‐up time of 6\\u2009months and for a subgroup 12\\xa0months. Our results show that the levels of therapeutic efficacy, quality‐of‐life and adverse events were highly similar before as compared to after the switch with a high degree of drug persistence, and that the patients were in general very satisfied with being transferred to self‐administered SC treatment.\\nFaecal calprotectin levels showed a statistically significant decrease for the cohort as a whole and for CD patients, while levels remained unchanged for UC patients. However, absolute levels were low and the observed decreases may not be clinically relevant. On the other hand, subclinical changes in faecal calprotectin levels are considered to precede changes in clinical disease activity and decreases of this type may further stabilise a state of clinical remission. Drug persistence was high with 95.5% of patients remaining on treatment after 6\\u2009months, and 88.5% after 12\\xa0months. These numbers are in line with those reported for IV vedolizumab treatment, ranging from 60–95% after 12\\xa0months. \\nOur evaluation of the outcome of the switch included thorough investigations of clinical disease activity, applying two activity indices for CD (patient‐based HBI and PRO2‐CD) and two for UC (SCCAI and PRO2‐UC), analysed by both median values and by proportions of patients in remission. All of these analyses corroborated the faecal calprotectin data, showing either unchanged disease activity levels after the switch in both CD and UC patients, or as in the case of SCCAI levels, a statistically significant improvement. For the 10 patients with perianal CD, the patient‐based HBI questionnaire was of particular interest since it included separate questions regarding active perianal fistula, perianal abscesses and anal fissures. At baseline, 3/10 had an active perianal disease but after the switch the number was 2/10 at follow‐up. From the literature, it seems that vedolizumab may have some therapeutic effect on perianal CD in a subset of patients, but that the effectiveness overall is moderate. Our results do not contradict this view, but one should be cautious regarding conclusions given the low number of patients with perianal CD.\\nWe also performed a subgroup analysis of patients with limited ileal CD, which showed measurable levels of faecal calprotectin with a numerical decrease after the switch. This confirms that faecal calprotectin was an adequate readout parameter also for this subset of CD patients, which has been debated but several recent studies have shown that faecal calprotectin is a sensitive measure of disease activity also in cases with limited ileal disease. \\nThe SC dose of 108\\u2009mg every 2\\u2009weeks was chosen by the manufacturer with the intent to provide patients with similar average serum concentrations at steady state, as the IV dose of 300\\u2009mg every 8\\u2009weeks. However, it is unclear whether average serum concentrations directly translate into levels of therapeutic efficacy. In addition, it is possible that the altered pharmacokinetics that comes with SC administration affect the various mechanisms of action of vedolizumab (i.e. those suggested to take place in the circulation compared to within tissues) in different ways. Although the VISIBLE studies gave us an indication as to what serum levels are common with SC vedolizumab at standard dose, the studies did not address which levels are therapeutically optimal. In our study, serum vedolizumab trough concentrations at steady state were approximately twice as high during SC as compared with IV treatment. These findings are in line with the VISIBLE studies and the study by Ventress et al. Our results suggest an inverse relationship between serum vedolizumab trough levels and faecal calprotectin levels with vedolizumab given IV. However, after 6\\u2009months with SC vedolizumab at standard dose, this correlation was not seen. This change was primarily observed in CD patients, which also displayed a statistically significant decrease in faecal calprotectin levels after having switched to SC treatment. Our subgroup analyses of patients that had been on optimised IV dosing did not show any signs of disease worsening in terms of remission rates, clinical index scores, biomarker levels or drug persistence, after the switch to standard SC dosing. Interestingly, patients on standard IV dosing showed a statistically significant improvement in faecal calprotectin levels on SC treatment, while other outcome measures remained unchanged. Taken together, these results suggest that some patients were underdosed when being on standard IV dosing and that they were more adequately dosed (or potentially overdosed at the group level) on SC standard dosing.\\nVentress et al. suggested that the first dose of SC vedolizumab should be given 28\\u2009days after the last IV dose. This was based on the assumption that the serum drug concentrations observed in the VISIBLE studies are therapeutically the most appropriate (although this has not been studied) and that the drug levels should be kept at or above this limit. With IV vedolizumab, patients' drug levels are below this limit during the entire second half of the 8‐week dosing interval. There is no evidence that the limited time that serum concentrations are below the SC serum steady‐state levels in the VISIBLE studies increases the risk of relapse, nor for dose‐dependent toxicity, if the first SC dose is given in close proximity to the last IV dose. Thus, with current knowledge and with support from our data we would argue that the first SC dose may be administered when the next IV dose would have been given, or earlier due to potential practical aspects.\\nIn our cohort, the rates of adverse events were similar before and after the switch, and no serious adverse events were reported. Some of the reported symptoms, including fatigue, headache, nausea and arthralgia, were transient and lasted 1–2\\u2009days after injection. The time to the maximum serum concentration after administration of vedolizumab subcutaneously is on average 7\\u2009days with a variation between 3–14\\u2009days. Such transient reactions are thus not likely to be an effect of the drug per se but more likely representing nonpharmacological potentially immune‐mediated adverse effects, alternatively representing a nocebo effect. Investigating local injection reactions, moderate discomfort, pain or burning sensations were reported by 5%–11% of patients, and corresponding severe reactions by 1% of the patients. Conversely, 88%–94% reported none or only mild local injection reactions. These results are in line with the VISIBLE studies as well as with data for other SC biologics. SC vedolizumab contains citrate which has been pointed out to be causing pain, but studies that have addressed this issue underscore that citrate is merely one of several factors that may affect potential pain sensation at SC injection and that some of the studies attributing pain at the injection site to citrate are difficult to interpret since citrate was one of several factors modified. Other factors that may be equally important in this context are other buffers commonly used such as phosphate and histidine, the buffer concentration, injected volume, solution temperature, pH, osmolality, needle gauge, injector device, injection speed, injection technique and low body weight. \\nWe also investigated various aspects of the patients' experience with the injector pen and the switch from IV to SC treatment. Overall patients found the injector pen to be user‐friendly and they were very satisfied with switching to SC treatment, which was reflected in all aspects explored. However, this dataset can also be used to illuminate the group of patients, albeit small (2%–9%), that preferred IV infusions. Thus, SC administration may not be the best option for all patients. One caveat with SC treatment is that it may be more difficult to ensure patient compliance. Hence, for patients where compliance historically has been a problem or if risk factors for non‐adherence are present, IV therapy may be advisable. \\nEvaluations of health‐related quality‐of‐life using the SHS instrument showed no statistically significant differences after the switch, but there was a slight numerical trend towards improved overall quality‐of‐life as well as better symptom‐related and social function‐related quality‐of‐life in patients with CD. These findings underscore the high level of satisfaction regarding the switch.\\nThe annualised cost of SC vedolizumab maintenance treatment was calculated to be 15.0% lower than for IV maintenance treatment. Another structural benefit was that nurse resources were liberated for other work tasks. This was especially valuable in times of a pandemic when the number of nurses at the outpatient clinic had to be diminished to enable staffing of Covid‐19 wards. In addition, avoiding hospital visits in this context was desirable to prevent transmission of the virus.\\nThis study had some important limitations. Firstly, there was no control group that was continued on IV treatment. Secondly, patients were not evaluated endoscopically. Lastly, anti‐drug antibodies were not measured.\\nIn conclusion, this study shows that a switch from IV to SC vedolizumab maintenance treatment can be done with maintained efficacy, safety and tolerability, including in patients on optimised IV vedolizumab dosing. In addition, patient satisfaction regarding the switch was overall high, although for a small proportion of patients IV treatment may be advisable. The appropriate window for serum vedolizumab concentration to target for combined optimal efficacy, patient convenience and cost‐effectiveness during SC maintenance treatment, is still unclear and should be addressed in future studies.\\nVB contributed with acquisition, analysis and interpretation of data, as well as study design and writing the manuscript.

       "    'fulltext': 'Paediatric ulcerative colitis [UC] and Crohn’s disease [CD] share many features with the adult forms of the illnesses. However, children with UC and CD also have age-related complications related to growth, development, nutrition, bone mineral density accretion and psychosocial needs. Unlike biological therapy in adults, where weight-based dosing is linear, in young children with a body weight <30 kg, a higher dose per kilogram may be required to achieve similar trough concentration levels. This highlights the importance of dose-ranging studies in paediatric inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] to determine the optimal dose in all paediatric age groups.\\nThe IBD treatment landscape has improved for children and adults since the development of biological therapy world-wide. In the USA, for example, several biologics are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration [FDA] for adults, two of which are also available for children. Intravenous [IV] infliximab [REMICADE, Janssen Biotech, Inc.] was the first to receive FDA approval for adults with UC and CD, and later for paediatric patients with IBD; subsequently, subcutaneous [SC] adalimumab [HUMIRA, AbbVie, Inc.] was FDA-approved for both adult and paediatric patients with UC and CD. IV and SC ustekinumab [STELARA, Janssen Biotech, Inc.] are FDA-approved for use only in adult, but not paediatric patients with UC and CD [currently in phase 3 trials in paediatric patients with CD and UC]. Oral tofacitinib [XELJANZ, Pfizer, Inc.] and SC golimumab [SIMPONI, Janssen Biotech] are both FDA-approved for adult patients with UC, whereas phase 3 trials in paediatric patients with UC are ongoing. IV vedolizumab [ENTYVIO, Takeda Pharmaceuticals U.S.A., Inc.] is indicated for adults with moderately to severely active UC and CD, and paediatric phase 3 trials in UC and CD are now underway. Real-world studies evaluating off-label use of biologics, such as ustekinumab and vedolizumab, in the paediatric population suggest positive outcomes, but the safety and efficacy findings await confirmation from clinical trial data.\\nIn previous adult studies of IV vedolizumab, positive exposure–response relationships for clinical response and remission were demonstrated, and these relationships appeared to be steeper in patients with UC than in those with CD. However, an effective and safe dose of IV vedolizumab in children has yet to be determined. Data from a previously developed population pharmacokinetic [PK] model based on vedolizumab phase 3 study results in adult patients with UC or CD were used to select the dose and weight groups evaluated in this paediatric study. Here, we now report results of HUBBLE, a paediatric phase 2 study of IV vedolizumab, a gut-selective monoclonal anti-α4β7-integrin antibody evaluating PK, safety and efficacy of IV vedolizumab in paediatric patients with UC and CD.\\nThis study enrolled male and female paediatric patients [aged 2–17 years; body weight ≥10 kg] with moderate to severe UC or CD who failed to respond or were intolerant to corticosteroids, immunomodulators and/or tumour necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists. Moderately to severely active UC was defined as a complete Mayo score of 6–12, a total of Mayo subscores of stool frequency and rectal bleeding of ≥4, and an endoscopy subscore of ≥2. Moderately to severely active CD was defined as a simple endoscopic score for CD [SES-CD] of ≥7, the CD activity index [CDAI] components of average daily abdominal pain score of >1, and total number of liquid/very soft stools >10 for the 7 days before the first dose of study drug. Patients were excluded for previous exposure to approved or investigational anti-integrins, positive progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy [PML] subjective symptom checklist, and current or anticipated surgical intervention for UC or CD. See the Supplementary Methods for complete inclusion and exclusion criteria.\\nHUBBLE [NCT03138655; EudraCT #2017-002231-41] was an international, phase 2, randomized, dose-ranging study. Patients with body weight ≥30 kg were enrolled at nine US and 14 non-US sites, and those weighing <30 kg were enrolled at seven US and 16 non-US sites. Patients were randomized 1:1 by body weight to receive a low or high IV vedolizumab dose [≥30 kg, 150 or 300 mg; <30 kg, 100 or 200 mg] on Day 1 and at Weeks 2, 6 and 14 [Supplementary Figure 1]. An interactive web response system was used for patient randomization and for dispensing medication ID number of the investigational drug. The high and low doses were selected on the basis of simulations performed using a population PK model derived from IV vedolizumab adult phase 3 data. Randomization was stratified by previous exposure/failure to TNFα antagonist therapy or naïvety to TNFα antagonist therapy, by indication [UC or CD] and by body weight group [≥30 or <30 kg]. Patients randomized to low-dose IV vedolizumab who did not show any clinical response were escalated to a high dose at Week 14. At Week 22, patients with clinical response could continue vedolizumab treatment in an extension study.\\nOral 5-aminosalicylic acid [5-ASA], immunomodulators and corticosteroids [CS] were permitted during the study. Oral 5-ASA and immunomodulators had to be maintained at a constant dose throughout the first 14 weeks of the study. CS could be maintained at a maximum dose of ≤50 mg/day of prednisone [or equivalent steroid] or could be tapered down from the maximum dose under a specific protocol [see Supplementary Methods for more details on permitted medications and the CS tapering protocol].\\nThe primary endpoints evaluated were PK parameters at Week 14 including area under the serum concentration curve [AUC], average concentration [Cavg] and observed serum concentration at the end of the dosing interval [Ctrough]. Blood samples for PK assessment were collected post-dose on Day 1 and at Weeks 1 and 2, between Weeks 2 and 6, at Weeks 6, 10, 14 and 22, and at the final safety visit 18 weeks after the last dose of the study.\\nVedolizumab serum concentrations were measured using a validated sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, as previously described. Immunogenicity of vedolizumab was measured on the basis of the development of anti-drug antibodies [ADAs]. Blood samples were obtained within 30 min before dosing on Day 1 and at Weeks 2, 6, 14 and 22/early termination visit, and at any unscheduled visit for a patient who experienced a serious adverse event [AE] or disease exacerbation. Serum titres of ADAs were determined using a validated drug-tolerant electrochemiluminescence assay.\\nDisease activity was assessed at screening and during the study for efficacy using the Mayo and paediatric UC activity index [PUCAI] scores in UC, and the CDAI, paediatric CD activity index [PCDAI] and SES-CD scores in CD. For the clinical components of the scores, patients with UC or CD, or their parents/legal guardians made daily entries into a diary, and laboratory results [CD only] were collected during screening and the study period. Flexible sigmoidoscopy/colonoscopy assessed by a central reader was used to assess the endoscopic component of the Mayo score in patients with UC and the SES-CD score in patients with CD.\\nSecondary efficacy endpoints included the proportion of patients with UC who achieved clinical response at Week 14—defined as a reduction in complete Mayo score of ≥3 points and ≥30% reduction from baseline, with an accompanying decrease in rectal bleeding subscore of ≥1 point or absolute rectal bleeding subscore of ≤1 point—and in CD as a ≥70-point decrease from baseline in CDAI score.\\nExploratory efficacy endpoints at Week 14 included: enhanced clinical response rate based on CDAI [≥100-point decrease from baseline in score]; clinical response rate based on a composite of SES-CD [≥50% reduction from baseline in score or score of 0–2] plus CDAI [decrease in average daily abdominal pain score of >0.25]; clinical response rate based on paediatric measures of PUCAI [≥20-point decrease from baseline in score] and PCDAI [≥15-point decrease from baseline in score and maximum total score of ≤30]; clinical remission rates based on each of the adult and paediatric measures [see definitions of clinical remission in Supplementary Methods]; and mean changes from baseline in faecal calprotectin.\\nThe IV vedolizumab exposure–response relationship was assessed at Week 14. This relationship was explored by evaluating Ctrough by clinical response in each treatment group, for each indication and weight group separately. Ctrough by clinical responsiveness was defined as a ≥3-point decrease and ≥30% reduction from baseline in complete Mayo score for UC, and a ≥70-point decrease from baseline in CDAI score for CD. According to paediatric measures, Ctrough by clinical responsiveness was defined as a ≥20-point decrease from baseline in PUCAI score for UC and ≥15-point decrease from baseline in PCDAI score for CD.\\nSafety assessments of all AEs and serious AEs that occurred throughout the study were conducted. AEs were categorized according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities [MedDRA; versions 22.0 and 23.0U].\\nThe full analysis set [FAS] and safety analysis set included all patients who received at least one dose of study drug according to the treatment they were randomized to receive or treatment that they actually received, respectively. The PK set was defined as all patients who received at least one dose of study drug and had at least one measurable concentration of vedolizumab. All statistical analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.2 or higher.\\nThe planned sample size was 80 patients including 40 with a body weight of ≥30 kg and 40 with a body weight of 10 to <30 kg. Randomization caps were implemented to ensure that the sample size for each dose regimen was a minimum of nine patients with UC and nine patients with CD per weight group. A sample size of nine patients was expected to have ≥80% power to establish 95% confidence intervals [CIs] that were between 60% and 140% of the geometric mean estimates for total clearance after IV vedolizumab administration for each dose, indication and weight group, assuming the inter-patient variability for clearance in the paediatric population was similar to that in the adult population [% coefficient of variation ≤36.6%]. The sample size was based on industry guidance and was not adjusted for anticipated dropouts. The planned sample size was intended to allow for descriptive analysis of exposure and efficacy for each indication and dosing group.\\nAll proportion-based efficacy endpoints are summarized by indication [UC or CD], weight group and treatment group. The point estimate, 95% Jeffrey’s interval and 95% CI based on Clopper–Pearson method are presented. Patients with any component of a scale missing were considered to be non-responders for that particular endpoint, scale and time point.\\nDescriptive statistics were used to summarize serum concentrations of vedolizumab over time and all PK parameters according to dose and weight groups; Ctrough was also summarized according to response status. The PK parameters were derived by compartmental and/or non-compartmental approaches. This study was not designed or powered for hypothesis testing or comparing different groups.\\nThe proportions of patients who were confirmed as ADA positive (persistent [positive ADA on at least two consecutive samples] or transient) or negative were summarized by weight group and treatment group for each indication separately in the FAS.

Data are available upon request via application at https://search.vivli.org.\\nThe patient, or the patient’s legally acceptable representative, signed and dated an informed consent/assent form and patient authorization form [if applicable] prior to entering the study. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board [or equivalent] at each participating centre.\\nThere were no differences in demographic characteristics between patients with UC and CD [Table 1]. There were some apparent differences between dose groups in baseline disease characteristics but comparisons are limited by the small sample size [Table 2].\\nPatient disposition in the study is shown in Figure 1. Twelve [27.3%] of 44 patients with UC and ten [22.2%] of 45 patients with CD discontinued from the study. There was no difference in the discontinuation rate between weight groups. Compliance [number of completed infusions out of a total of four infusions] was 99% for patients weighing ≥30 kg and 98% for those <30 kg, with an overall mean (standard deviation [SD]) of 3.7 [0.7] and 3.7 [0.9] infusions completed [total amount of study drug infused] respectively.\\nIn these paediatric patients with moderately to severely active UC and CD, vedolizumab serum exposure increased in an approximately dose-proportional manner for both weight groups. Consistently higher Ctrough at Week 14 were observed in the high-dose groups, and Week 14 Cavg increased ~2-fold over the dose range from 150 to 300 mg in patients weighing ≥30 kg and from 100 to 200 mg in patients <30 kg [Figure 2]. Mean [SD] Ctrough for all patients [combined CD and UC] was 10.4 [13.8] and 14.7 [15.7] µg/mL in patients weighing ≥30 kg and 9.0 [8.4] and 10.5 [10.5] µg/mL in those weighing <30 kg in the low- and high-dose groups, respectively.\\nIn paediatric patients weighing ≥30 kg, vedolizumab Week 14 serum concentrations and derived PK parameters [particularly Ctrough but less so AUC or Cavg] were higher for patients with UC compared with patients with CD. This difference was not observed for patients weighing <30 kg.\\nSix [6.8%] of 88 patients were ADA-positive. Three patients [all with UC] were persistently ADA-positive [with two or more consecutive confirmed positive samples]. Among patients weighing ≥30 kg, 12.0% [3/25] with UC [all in the 150 mg group] were ADA-positive at any time during the study and 8.7% [2/23] with CD were ADA-positive [both patients were in the 300 mg group]. Among patients weighing <30 kg, 5.3% [1/19] with UC [100 mg group] were ADA-positive but no patients with CD were ADA-positive. Overall, there was no apparent trend suggesting that positive ADA status had a negative impact on PK parameters or achievement of clinical response at Week 14. However, interpretation of this is limited due to the small number of patients who were positive for ADA.\\nThere was no trend showing that co-administration of immunomodulators was associated with a decrease in ADA rate in patients weighing ≥30 kg for both UC and CD. The impact of immunomodulators on immunogenicity in patients weighing <30 kg could not be evaluated because there was only one positive ADA case in this group.\\nAccording to adult measures, clinical response rates across weight and dose groups at Week 14 ranged from 40.0 to 69.2% in patients with UC [based on a reduction in complete Mayo score of ≥3 points and ≥30% from baseline] and from 33.3 to 63.6% in patients with CD [based on a ≥70-point decrease from baseline in CDAI score] [Table 3]. The enhanced clinical response rates [≥100-point decrease from baseline in CDAI score] at Week 14 ranged from 25.0% to 63.6% in patients with CD [Supplementary Table 1]. Clinical response [based on a composite of improvements in CDAI abdominal pain/stool subscores and SES-CD score] occurred at lower rates than the other clinical endpoints in patients with CD [Supplementary Table 2].\\nAccording to paediatric measures, clinical response rates across weight and dose groups at Week 14 ranged from 50.0 to 80.0% in patients with UC [based on a ≥20-point decrease from baseline in PUCAI score] and from 45.5 to 54.5% in patients with CD [based on a ≥15-point decrease in PCDAI score] [Supplementary Table 3].\\nIn the evaluation of vedolizumab exposure–response, in patients with UC, generally a higher Ctrough was observed in patients who achieved clinical response at Week 14 compared with patients who did not achieve clinical response in each dose arm according to complete Mayo and PUCAI scores. This trend was not observed in patients with CD, based on CDAI and PCDAI scores [adult measures are shown in Figure 3 and paediatric measures in Supplementary Table 4].\\nClinical remission rates at Week 14 according to adult and paediatric measures are reported in Supplementary Tables 5 and 6, respectively. In patients with UC, clinical remission rates across weight and dose groups at Week 14 ranged from 20.0 to 38.5% on Mayo and from 30.0 to 61.5% on PUCAI. In patients with CD, clinical remission rates across weight and dose groups at Week 14 ranged from 50.0 to 63.6% on CDAI and from 16.7 to 54.5% on PCDAI. Faecal calprotectin levels at baseline were highly variable, with change during treatment seen across most dosing and weight groups in UC and CD [Supplementary Table 7].\\nThe overall duration of exposure to vedolizumab was a median of 99.0 days in both weight groups with a range of 98.0–100.5 days. The incidence of AEs was similar between both disease indications in both weight groups: among patients with UC and CD, at least one AE was experienced by 80.0% and 91.3% of patients weighing ≥30 kg, respectively, and 84.2% and 90.5% of patients weighing <30 kg, respectively; most AEs were considered mild and not related to study drug [Table 4]. Of the 22 patients who discontinued, 15 discontinued due to AEs; of these, 13 were due to AEs of worsening UC or CD. Headache was the most commonly reported AE in the ≥30 kg group and abdominal pain was the most frequently reported AE in the <30 kg group. In patients with UC, headaches affected <10% of patients in the ≥30 kg group and 10.5% of patients in the <30 kg group. In patients with CD, headaches affected 21.7% of patients in the ≥30 kg group and <10% of patients in the <30 kg group. Abdominal pain affected <10% of patients with UC and CD in the ≥30 kg group and 21.1% of patients with UC and 28.6% of patients with CD in the <30 kg group [all AEs that occurred in ≥10% of patients are reported in Supplementary Table 8]. Most AEs of abdominal pain were mild to moderate in intensity and not related to study drug; they were possibly related to underlying disease pathology. Infections and infestations occurred in 48.0% of patients with UC and 47.8% of patients with CD in the ≥30 kg group (most were reported as viral infections [10.4% of total UC and CD patients] or ear infections, nasopharyngitis, pharyngitis or upper respiratory tract infection [6.3% each of total UC and CD patients]), and 36.8% and 28.6% in patients with UC and CD, respectively, in the <30 kg group [only upper respiratory tract infection, respiratory tract infection and viral infections were reported in more than one patient]. There were no cases of PML during the study.\\nSerious AEs occurred in 20% of patients with UC and 26.1% of patients with CD in the ≥30 kg group and 26.3% and 33.3%, respectively, in the <30 kg group [Table 4]. A single serious AE of viral infection in a patient with CD in the dose-escalation group was considered related to vedolizumab treatment, but no change was made to study medication. No deaths occurred during the study.\\nThe criteria applied for the identification of hypersensitivity included standardized MedDRA queries of anaphylactic/anaphylactoid shock conditions [broad], angio-oedema [broad] and hypersensitivity [broad]. Among patients weighing ≥30 kg, ten [20.8%] reported hypersensitivity AEs. Although most were mild or moderate, there was one severe hypersensitivity AE [erythema nodosum] which was described as non-serious, unrelated to treatment, and not requiring any change to the dose of study medication, and two hypersensitivity AEs that were assessed as being related to treatment [asthma and hypersensitivity]. Among patients weighing <30 kg, hypersensitivity AEs were reported for four [10%], all of which were mild or moderate in intensity; none were assessed as being related to treatment. None of the hypersensitivity AEs were reported as serious AEs, and no cases of anaphylaxis or infusion-related reactions were reported in either cohort. One patient with hypersensitivity reactions was persistently positive for ADA and was positive for neutralizing ADA. There was no relationship between persistent ADA and hypersensitivity reaction.\\nIn this study, vedolizumab PK parameters were evaluated in a paediatric UC and CD population. The exposure in paediatric patients reported in this study [Ctrough levels of 9.0–14.7 µg/mL] can be considered efficacious and within the range of therapeutic levels in adult patients after standard IV induction doses, based on PK data and modelling from previous adult phase 3 studies. In paediatric patients with moderately to severely active UC and CD, vedolizumab serum exposure increased in an approximately dose-proportional manner for both weight groups, and achieved concentrations similar to those of adults from the previous GEMINI trials. Consistently higher Ctrough concentrations at Week 14 were observed in the high-dose groups.\\nIn addition, vedolizumab serum concentrations and derived PK parameters at Week 14 were higher for paediatric patients weighing ≥30 kg with UC compared with patients with CD, whereas this difference was not observed for patients weighing <30 kg. However, there was variability in exposure observed across the study population, which was more apparent in Ctrough than Cavg. Indeed, the difference between these UC and CD groups was much more apparent for Ctrough levels, whereas Cavg levels were generally more comparable, suggesting broadly similar PK characteristics between the patients with UC and CD.\\nThe vedolizumab exposure–response relationship results showed that in patients with UC, Ctrough at Week 14 was generally higher in responders than in non-responders in both treatment arms for both weight groups. However, due to the small sample size, these data do not clearly show that higher dosing in patients with UC was associated with superior clinical outcomes. In patients with CD, there was no clear trend for a higher Ctrough in responders for both weight groups. No firm conclusion can be drawn regarding the exposure–response relationship in patients with UC or CD due to the small sample size. In patients with UC weighing ≥30 kg, response rates were generally greater in the low-dose vs high-dose group, with somewhat overlapping 95% CIs, whereas the high-dose group was favoured over the low-dose group in those weighing <30 kg. This may be due to slight differences in baseline disease characteristics such as higher baseline Mayo score, Mayo endoscopic subscore and C-reactive protein level in the high-dose group of patients with UC weighing ≥30 kg, as well as the higher proportion of patients with severe baseline PUCAI scores in the high-dose group. The baseline disease characteristics in patients with UC weighing <30 kg were generally similar between dose groups. There were no clear differences in efficacy among dose groups in the patients with CD.\\nThe current paediatric UC population in this study and adult population in the GEMINI 1 study had similar disease severity and similar prior exposure to TNF antagonist drugs at baseline. However, with regard to CD, baseline CDAI scores were higher in adults [GEMINI 2] but baseline median faecal calprotectin and C-reactive protein levels were higher in the children in this study, and a greater proportion of children had been previously exposed to TNFα antagonist therapy. It is important to note that CDAI is a disease activity score for adults with CD, which makes translatability to the paediatric population difficult; however, this scoring index has also been previously used for regulatory purposes. It is interesting to compare the current results in children vs those previously reported for adults in the GEMINI trials, although it should be noted that vedolizumab exposure and clinical response were assessed at different time points in HUBBLE [Week 14] vs GEMINI 1 and 2 [Week 6]. Overall, the current PK parameters and the dose-proportional increase in serum concentration levels in paediatric patients were consistent with previous data shown in adults across the same dose range. Vedolizumab treatment with 150 and 300 mg IV doses [≥30 kg group] and 100 and 200 mg IV doses [<30 kg group] in paediatric patients with UC or CD resulted in similar clinical responses at Week 14 to those observed in adults in the previous phase 3 studies of IV vedolizumab [300 mg] during induction therapy [Week 6]. In the phase 3 GEMINI 1 study, clinical response was achieved by 47.1% of adults with UC who were evaluated at Week 6 of induction therapy [300 mg IV vedolizumab]. In contrast, at Week 14 of the current study, clinical response was achieved in 56.0% of children with UC weighing ≥30 kg [150 and 300 mg IV vedolizumab] and in 52.6% of children with UC weighing <30 kg [100 and 200 mg IV vedolizumab]. In the phase 3 GEMINI 2 study, a reduction of CDAI score by ≥100 points was achieved by 31.4% of adults with CD who were evaluated at Week 6 of induction therapy [300 mg IV vedolizumab]. In contrast, at Week 14 of the current study, a reduction of CDAI score by ≥100 points was achieved in 30.4% of children with CD weighing ≥30 kg [150 and 300 mg IV vedolizumab] and in 47.6% of children with CD weighing <30 kg [100 and 200 mg IV vedolizumab]. Although fixed dosing in this phase 2 paediatric study appeared to be adequate compared with the adult trials, further study is needed on maintenance dosing strategies in the paediatric population, especially in the lowest weight group of <30 kg.\\nVedolizumab was generally safe and well tolerated when administered at either 150 and 300 mg in paediatric patients weighing ≥30 kg or at 100 and 200 mg in patients weighing <30 kg, with a comparable safety profile in both weight groups. The overall safety profile observed in this study is generally consistent with the known safety profile of vedolizumab in adults and with the common symptoms of IBD.\\nThis study has some limitations. It was not designed or powered for comparing between-group differences in PK parameters, but for descriptive analysis of exposure and efficacy within each indication and dosing group. Any potential inaccuracies in pre-dose sampling time and in a study of this sample size would lead to variability in the PK parameters, in particular Ctrough levels, although Cavg would be less affected. The small number of paediatric patients, especially in the youngest age group, precluded concrete interpretation of comparisons between disease indication, weight group and/or dose group for baseline characteristics, safety and clinical response. Additionally, Mayo and CDAI scores were not designed to assess clinical response in children; however, at the time of this phase 2 trial, these measures were recommended by regulatory agencies to enable comparison of paediatric results to previous adult data. Future paediatric IBD studies will probably use paediatric measures [PUCAI and PCDAI] or the SES-CD.\\nIn conclusion, vedolizumab serum exposure increased in an approximately dose-proportional manner in this paediatric population, and vedolizumab exposure, clinical response and safety were considered similar in children relative to adult patients in historical studies. The results from the HUBBLE study, in conjunction with adult data from the GEMINI studies, have been used to determine ideal dosing schedules for further studies in paediatric patients.\\nParts of these data were presented at the 2021 Digestive Disease Week, May 21–23, 2021, virtual congress, Poster Su497, and the 2021 World Congress of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, June 2–5, 2021, virtual congress, Poster G-ePwP-064.\\nThis work was supported by Takeda.

       "    'fulltext': \"Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn disease (CD) are serious, chronic inflammatory bowel diseases that generally require long‐term maintenance therapy. Treatment guidelines from the American College of Gastroenterology and the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation recommend consideration of biologic therapies that target tumor necrosis factor, integrins, or interleukins for patients with moderate to severe disease who do not respond to, or are intolerant of, conventional therapy. However, biologic therapies harbor an intrinsic risk for the development of antidrug antibodies (ADAs), which can be associated with a reduction in primary therapeutic efficacy, loss of response after an initial response, and potential for increased adverse events. Given the clinical implications of safe and effective treatment, additional evaluation of immunogenicity associated with more recently approved biologics is warranted.\\nVedolizumab is a gut‐selective, α4β7 integrin–binding, humanized monoclonal antibody that is approved to treat moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis and Crohn Disease. Previous phase 3, double‐blind, randomized, placebo‐controlled studies demonstrated that vedolizumab was effective and well tolerated in patients with ulcerative colitis (GEMINI 1) or Crohn Disease (GEMINI 2 and 3). Furthermore, vedolizumab therapy induced low immunogenicity rates in patients with ulcerative colitis (GEMINI 1) or Crohn Disease (GEMINI 2). In the GEMINI long‐term safety (LTS) study, long‐term vedolizumab therapy was well tolerated and provided both clinical and health‐related quality‐of‐life benefits. \\nImmunogenicity was initially assessed using a drug‐sensitive enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in prior studies and in GEMINI long term safety. To address the limitation of drug‐sensitive assays, a new drug‐tolerant acid dissociation electrochemiluminescence (ECL) assay was developed and used on samples collected from July 15, 2015, onward, and on a small subset of samples collected before that date. Here, we report long‐term vedolizumab immunogenicity rates using the ECL assay in patients with ulcerative colitis or Crohn Disease who participated in the GEMINI program (GEMINI 1, 2, and 3 and GEMINI long term safety), including those who received vedolizumab continuously and those who received vedolizumab induction therapy and were then randomized to placebo maintenance treatment in GEMINI 1 or 2 before being re‐treated with vedolizumab in GEMINI long term safety (treatment interruption).\\nThe GEMINI long term safety study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and in compliance with the institutional review board regulations of the US Code of Federal Regulations, Good Clinical Practice regulations and guidelines, and all applicable local regulations. All patients gave written informed consent.\\nGEMINI long term safety was a multicenter, open‐label study that enrolled patients from a long‐term phase 2 study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00619489), GEMINI 1, GEMINI 2, GEMINI 3, and vedolizumab‐naive (de novo) patients. The GEMINI 1, 2, and 3 trial eligibility criteria have been previously reported. Patients in the GEMINI long term safety de novo cohort were adults aged 18 to 80 years with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (based on a partial Mayo score) or Crohn Disease (based on the Harvey‐Bradshaw Index), diagnosed within 3 months from enrollment. Patients were excluded if they had an abdominal abscess, extensive colonic resection, short bowel syndrome or a history of >3 small‐bowel resections, symptomatic intestinal stenosis or a stoma, malignancy, chronic hepatitis B or C infection, active or latent tuberculosis, or immunodeficiency. Patients with unstable or uncontrolled medical conditions, surgery requiring general anesthesia within 30 days from enrollment, plans to undergo major surgery during the study period, clinically relevant laboratory abnormalities, current or recent drug or alcohol dependence, or active psychiatric disease were also excluded. Intake of cyclosporine or thalidomide within 30 days of enrollment; infliximab or certolizumab pegol within 60 days of enrollment; or natalizumab, efalizumab, or rituximab at any time were not permitted. Further details on the GEMINI long term safety study can be found in the published report. \\nPatients from GEMINI 1 and 2 received either placebo or vedolizumab 300 mg intravenous (IV) induction. At week 6, patients with a clinical response to vedolizumab were randomly assigned to maintenance treatment with placebo, vedolizumab every 8 weeks (Q8W), or vedolizumab every 4 weeks (Q4W). All patients from GEMINI 3 received vedolizumab 300 mg IV induction only, before enrolling in GEMINI long term safety, in which all patients were treated with vedolizumab 300 mg IV Q4W. As a result, patients in GEMINI long term safety could have been treated with vedolizumab continuously or could have had initial vedolizumab induction treatment followed by placebo maintenance and then vedolizumab re‐treatment in GEMINI long term safety (Figure\\xa01).\\nBlood samples for evaluating vedolizumab immunogenicity (the presence of vedolizumab ADAs in serum) were collected during GEMINI 1, 2, and 3 at weeks 0 and 6, and then every 12\\xa0weeks until week 52; these have been reported elsewhere. In GEMINI long term safety, blood samples were collected before vedolizumab infusion at week 4; at 16‐week intervals from week 20 to week 196; at weeks 220, 248, 272, 300, 324, and 352; and at the final safety visit 16\\xa0weeks after the last vedolizumab infusion. Immunogenicity was initially assessed using a validated, drug‐sensitive, biotinylated, bridging ELISA. To address the possible underestimation of on‐drug immunogenicity that may occur with a drug‐sensitive assay, a new drug‐tolerant assay was later developed using acid dissociation ECL. This new assay has a drug tolerance of at least 50\\xa0μg/mL of vedolizumab with 500\\xa0ng/mL of positive control (affinity purified rabbit anti‐vedolizumab antibodies), ≤25\\xa0μg/mL of vedolizumab with 100\\xa0ng/mL of positive control, and ≤5\\xa0μg/mL of vedolizumab with 10\\xa0ng/mL of positive control. The ECL assay was used on samples collected from July 15, 2015, onward and also on a small subset collected before that date. We report the results of ADA assessment using the ECL assay.\\nPersistently ADA‐positive patients were defined as those with at least 2 consecutive confirmed positive results in GEMINI 1, 2, or 3 or GEMINI long term safety. Confirmed ADA‐positive samples were further assessed for the ability of ADA to neutralize vedolizumab binding to recombinant human integrin α4β7, using a drug‐tolerant acid dissociation ECL assay. This new neutralization assay has a drug tolerance of at least 50 μg/mL of vedolizumab with 250 ng/mL of positive control (affinity purified rabbit anti‐vedolizumab antibodies), up to 5 μg/mL of vedolizumab with 80 ng/mL of positive control, and no drug tolerance at 36 ng/mL of positive control. Incidence of investigator‐defined infusion‐related reactions was also analyzed.\\nData on patient baseline demographics and disease characteristics included all patients with ADA results. Data on the ADA status overall and by study visit, concomitant immunomodulator use, and occurrence of infusion‐related reactions included patients with ADA results obtained using the ECL assay. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize all data.\\nImmunogenicity was originally assessed using an ELISA in all 2206 patients from GEMINI long term safety: 1966 had been treated with vedolizumab continuously and 240 were re‐treated with vedolizumab following a break in previous vedolizumab therapy. Patients treated continuously with vedolizumab (n = 1966) included 752 (38.3%) patients with ulcerative colitis and 1214 (61.7%) patients with Crohn Disease. Patients treated with placebo maintenance in GEMINI 1 or 2 and then re‐treated with vedolizumab in GEMINI long term safety (n = 240) included 113 (47.1%) with ulcerative colitis and 127 (52.9%) with Crohn Disease. Patient characteristics, disease characteristics, and rates of concomitant immunomodulator or corticosteroid use were similar between the 2 groups at time of enrollment in GEMINI long term safety (Table\\xa01). Vedolizumab ADA data collected in GEMINI 1 and 2 before the first vedolizumab dose showed <1% of vedolizumab‐treated patients were ADA‐positive using both ECL (9/1427) and ELISA (13/1434) assays.\\nVedolizumab ADA data from a new ECL assay were available for 1753 of 2206 patients enrolled in GEMINI long term safety: 1513 had received continuous treatment, and 240 had been re‐treated with vedolizumab. Among patients continuously treated with vedolizumab, 36 of 1513 (2.4%) were ADA positive at ≥1 assessments during GEMINI 1, 2, 3, or long term safety, of which 15 were persistently positive and 20 developed neutralizing antibodies. Among the patients who were re‐treated with vedolizumab during GEMINI long term safety, 53 of 240 (22.1%) were ADA positive at any time, 42 were persistently positive, and 40 developed neutralizing antibodies (Table\\xa02).\\nLongitudinal assessment of ADAs in patients from the start of GEMINI 1 or 2 through GEMINI long term safety showed lower cumulative vedolizumab immunogenicity rates for the Q8W and Q4W cohorts who received vedolizumab maintenance (4.3% [10/234] and 3.0% [7/234], respectively) than for patients who received placebo maintenance after vedolizumab induction (22.1% [53/240]). In the placebo maintenance cohort, rates of ADA positivity were 1.3% (3/234) at the end of induction and increased after a break in treatment during maintenance therapy (8.7% [18/206], 20.2% [24/119], and 19.4% [21/108] at weeks 14, 38, and 52, respectively). ADA positivity rates after vedolizumab re‐treatment in GEMINI long term safety were 7.7% (1/13) at week 4, 0 at weeks 20 and 36, and remained at or near 0 through 404 weeks of treatment (Table\\xa03).\\nADA positivity rates were lower among patients continuously treated with vedolizumab with or without immunomodulator coadministration: 3 of 385 (0.8%) versus 28 of 980 (2.9%), respectively. In the vedolizumab–re‐treated group, 40 of 151 (26.5%) patients without concomitant immunomodulator use were ADA‐positive compared with 7 of 65 (10.8%) patients with concomitant immunomodulator use (Table\\xa04).\\nOverall, 100 of 1753 (5.7%) patients reported an infusion reaction: 87 of 1513 (5.8%) in the continuous vedolizumab group and 13 of 240 (5.4%) in the vedolizumab–re‐treated group. Rates of ADAs were similar between patients with infusion reactions and those without in the continuously treated cohort (1.1% [1/87] vs 2.5% [35/1426]) or the re‐treated cohort (23.1% [3/13] vs 22.0% [50/227]). None of the 87 patients receiving continuous vedolizumab who had an infusion reaction were persistently ADA positive, whereas 2 of 13 (15.4%) patients re‐treated with vedolizumab who had an infusion reaction were persistently ADA positive (Table\\xa05). Infusion reaction rates were low overall and occurred at a similar frequency in patients who were ADA positive vs ADA‐negative in the continuously treated cohort (2.8% [1/36] vs 5.8% [86/1477], respectively) and in the re‐treated cohort (5.7% [3/53] vs 5.3% [10/187], respectively).\\nIn this study, a total of 36 of 1513 (2.4%) patients continuously treated with vedolizumab had at least 1 confirmed ADA‐positive serum sample measured with a validated ECL assay; 15 patients were persistently positive, and 20 had neutralizing antibodies. These results are in line with previously published immunogenicity rates using an ELISA in GEMINI 1 and 2, wherein 56 of 1434 (3.9%) patients treated with vedolizumab for up to 52 weeks were ADA positive; 9 patients were persistently positive, and 33 developed neutralizing antibodies. Unlike previous analyses, the present study specifically investigated vedolizumab immunogenicity in a subset of patients in GEMINI long term safety who received vedolizumab induction treatment followed by placebo maintenance treatment, then received vedolizumab retreatment during GEMINI long term safety. More patients in this interrupted cohort were ADA positive than patients in the continuous vedolizumab cohort at any time (22.1% vs 2.4%, respectively). More patients re‐treated with vedolizumab than treated with continuous vedolizumab were persistently ADA positive and developed neutralizing antibodies. The reason for this observation is currently unknown. However, similar to previous observations in the GEMINI long term safety study, the rate of ADA development did not seem to be dependent on the duration of treatment interruption. Additionally, longitudinal immunogenicity rates in re‐treated patients increased during placebo maintenance and then decreased in GEMINI long term safety to levels similar to patients treated with continuous vedolizumab.\\nImmunogenicity rates were not compared statistically between Q4W and Q8W vedolizumab dosing; however, the differences are expected because vedolizumab levels at Q4W are higher than at Q8W treatment. This highlights a limitation of the ECL assay, in which higher (>25 μg/mL) vedolizumab trough concentrations may interfere with the detection of low‐titer ADA (ie, 10 ng/mL rabbit anti‐vedolizumab positive control used during validation). \\nWhile some studies indicated vedolizumab immunogenicity was not impacted by concomitant immunomodulator use, possibly because of relatively low overall vedolizumab immunogenicity rates. Other studies have indicated concomitant immunomodulators therapy was associated with decreased immunogenicity. In the current analysis, immunogenicity was lower in the continuously vedolizumab‐treated patients receiving concomitant immunomodulators compared with those who were not (0.8% vs 2.9%). However, importantly in context of treatment interruptions, fewer patients in the vedolizumab–re‐treated group with than without concomitant immunomodulator use were observed to be ADA positive (10.8% vs 26.5%). The lower ADA rate observed with concomitant immunomodulators vs without immunomodulators is in line with other research on immunomodulators and biologic therapeutics. The development of ADAs has been associated with an increased risk of infusion reactions, particularly with anti–tumor necrosis factor therapy. In contrast, consistent with previous reports, the current analysis does not indicate that ADA status affects the rate of infusion reactions for vedolizumab. Rates of infusion reactions were similar in ADA‐positive vs ADA‐negative patients in the continuously treated cohort (1/87 [1.1%] vs 35/1426 [2.5%]) and in the re‐treated group (3/13 [23.1%] vs 50/227 [22.0%]). Altogether, these results suggest a low impact of immunogenicity on vedolizumab safety in inflammatory bowel disease. \\nAlthough vedolizumab clinical efficacy was not explored in this post hoc analysis, real‐world data support the conclusion that ADAs do not appear to play a major role in vedolizumab efficacy, even in patients who discontinue and later restart vedolizumab treatment. This is further supported by previously published results and that low‐titer ADA positive status (10‐50 titer values) had minimal effect on the pharmacokinetics of vedolizumab, whereas higher‐titer ADAs (≥250 titer values) affect vedolizumab clearance. Additionally, a recent report suggested that immunogenicity was not a primary driver of vedolizumab treatment failure. \\nThis post hoc analysis of ADA using a new drug‐tolerant ECL assay in patients treated continuously with vedolizumab and patients retreated with vedolizumab provides additional evidence supporting low overall immunogenicity rates, even with long‐term vedolizumab use. Treatment interruption induced an increase in ADA rates that decreased with vedolizumab retreatment. There was no substantial difference in infusion reactions between the 2 cohorts, suggesting only minimal clinical impact from a transient increase in vedolizumab immunogenicity.\\nTimothy Wyant and Richard A.

       "    'fulltext': 'Biologic therapies can trigger the formation of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs), an immune reaction identified as a contributor to loss of therapeutic response. As such, it is important to understand the extent to which biologic therapies induce an immunogenic response and whether immunogenicity has an adverse impact on pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, or efficacy.\\nVedolizumab is a humanized recombinant monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the α4β7 integrin and prevents the recruitment of α4β7 integrin leucocytes to the gut. Vedolizumab safety and efficacy are well established from multiple clinical and real-world studies, and it is approved for the treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD). Pivotal vedolizumab phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind studies included GEMINI 1 (NCT00783718) in UC and GEMINI 2 (NCT00783692) and 3 (NCT01224171) in CD.\\nVedolizumab immunogenicity was initially assessed in patients from GEMINI 1 and GEMINI 2 using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), which was state of the art at the time. Fifty-six of 1434 patients evaluated (4%) demonstrated vedolizumab ADA positivity at any time during the studies. Nine patients were considered persistently ADA-positive (defined as positive ADA in 2 or more consecutive samples), and 33 patients developed neutralizing antibodies. However, based on the assay validation, it was known that the presence of ~\\u20090.5 to 1\\xa0μg/mL vedolizumab with 500\\xa0ng/mL ADA-positive control in the serum interferes with the ELISA. As a result, it is possible that the on-drug immunogenicity rates may have been underestimated.\\nAn acid dissociation electrochemiluminescence (ECL) ADA assay with a higher drug tolerance to detect ADAs in the presence of vedolizumab was developed and used to reassess vedolizumab immunogenicity in these patients. In addition, a more drug-tolerant ECL assay was developed to detect neutralizing ADAs to further characterize the confirmed positive ADA samples. Here, we present updated combined GEMINI 1 and GEMINI 2 vedolizumab immunogenicity results as assessed with improved ECL ADA assays and compare the magnitude of the impact on immunogenicity between the drug-tolerant and drug-sensitive assays.\\nVedolizumab ADAs were initially measured using an ELISA with a drug tolerance of 0.5\\xa0μg/mL vedolizumab at 500\\xa0ng/mL positive control (affinity purified rabbit anti-vedolizumab antibodies) and ≤\\u200920\\xa0μg/mL vedolizumab at 5\\xa0μg/mL positive control and assay sensitivity of 0.44\\xa0ng/mL. As an alternative to the traditional ELISA previously used to analyze vedolizumab immunogenicity, our team (Takeda Pharmaceuticals International Inc., Cambridge, MA) developed a new ADA assay using acid dissociation ECL. This new assay has a drug tolerance of at least 50\\xa0μg/mL vedolizumab with 500\\xa0ng/mL positive control, ≤\\u200925\\xa0μg/mL vedolizumab with 100\\xa0ng/mL positive control, and ≤\\u20095\\xa0μg/mL vedolizumab with 10\\xa0ng/mL positive control. Relative assay sensitivity using a positive control was 3.9\\xa0ng/mL, with inter- and intra-assay coefficients of variability for positive control and negative controls (a pooled human serum) <\\u200925%. All available banked serum samples from GEMINI 1 and GEMINI 2 were tested for the presence of ADAs, followed by confirmation and titration in ECL and ELISA (Table I), and results were then compared between the two assays.\\nImmunogenicity was evaluated by the ADA and neutralizing antibody status. Positive or negative ADA status was determined according to the definitions previously established to assess ELISA results, wherein samples that were positive in both the screening and confirmatory assays were designated as positive. ADA transient positive was defined as a patient who had tested ADA-positive at least once at any time during the treatment or post-treatment periods. ADA persistent positive was defined as a patient who had tested ADA-positive on at least two sequential time points during the treatment or post-treatment periods.\\nA qualitative bridging assay format was used. The plate was pre-coated with vedolizumab, and the immobilized vedolizumab captured the ADA in serum samples, followed by biotinylated-vedolizumab and HRP-labeled streptavidin. When incubated with tetramethylbenzidine substrate, positive color development indicated the presence of ADAs in the samples.\\nSamples confirmed ADA-positive by ELISA were subsequently analyzed for neutralizing ability against vedolizumab using the cell line RPM18866 (human myelogenous leukemia, lymphocyte B cell line) that expresses vedolizumab’s target α4β7 on the cell surface. In the absence of any neutralizing antibodies, addition of a biotinylated-vedolizumab resulted in specific binding of vedolizumab to the cell surface. This bound drug was detected by the addition of streptavidin-PE, which also binds to the bound biotinylated vedolizumab, and evaluated on a flow cytometer. Mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) expression correlated to the amount of bound drug on the cell surface. The presence of neutralizing antibodies in the patient serum prevented biotinylated vedolizumab from binding to the RPM18866 cell surface. A reduction of the MFI as compared to the MFI of negative control serum sample indicated neutralization.\\nPatient serum samples, positive controls, and negative controls were first diluted and incubated with 300\\xa0mM acetic acid (pH\\xa03), followed by a neutralization step containing 1\\xa0M TRIS buffer (pH\\xa09.5), biotinylated vedolizumab, and SULFO-TAG-vedolizumab (SULFO-TAG is a product of Meso Scale Discovery). The samples were incubated on a polypropylene microtiter plate. During this time, ADA bound to both the biotinylated vedolizumab and SULFO-TAG-vedolizumab formed an antibody-drug complex bridge. After incubation, the mixture was added to the wells of a blocked streptavidin-coated MSD plate, which allowed biotin-drug-Ab-SULFO-TAG drug complexes to bind to the streptavidin-coated plate. After washing, tripropylamine-containing read buffer was added, and the chemiluminescent signal was measured in relative light unit by a SECTOR Imager 600/6000 instrument.\\nSamples confirmed ADA-positive by ECL assay were subsequently analyzed in a new drug-tolerant neutralizing assay in which ADAs in patient serum samples were captured by biotinylated vedolizumab that was bound to a streptavidin-coated plate. After washing, the bound ADA was released with an acid dissociation step. The extracted ADAs were incubated with SULFO-TAG-vedolizumab before transferring to a α4β7-coated MSD plate. The tripropylamine-containing buffer was used for ECL signal detection. A decreased signal when compared with the negative control serum samples indicated the presence of neutralizing ADA.\\nGEMINI 1 was a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study consisting of separate induction and maintenance phases in patients with moderately to severely active UC. The induction phase included 2 patient cohorts: in cohort 1, patients were randomly assigned to receive vedolizumab or placebo, and cohort 2 received open-label vedolizumab. Patients from either cohort who demonstrated clinical response to vedolizumab at week 6 were re-randomized to receive vedolizumab every 8\\xa0weeks (Q8W) and every 4\\xa0weeks (Q4W) or placebo up to week 52 beginning at week 6 (maintenance intent-to-treat [ITT] population).\\nGEMINI 2 was a similarly designed trial in patients with moderately to severely active CD. Efficacy and safety outcomes have been previously reported. In GEMINI 1 and GEMINI 2, patient blood samples were collected at weeks 0 (predose), 6, 14, 26, 38, 52 (or early termination), and 66 (final safety visit for patients not enrolled in the extended access program).\\nPatients were grouped based on vedolizumab treatment duration in GEMINI 1 and GEMINI 2. The first group included patients who never received vedolizumab (true placebo), that is, those who were randomized to placebo beginning at week 0 and did not receive vedolizumab in either the induction or maintenance phases (n\\u2009=\\u2009297). The second group was the placebo (ITT) group, which consisted of patients who received only 2 doses of vedolizumab during the induction phase and were then randomized to receive placebo (n\\u2009=\\u2009279). The third group consisted of patients who received vedolizumab up to week 52, that is, those who were maintained on open-label vedolizumab Q4W (n\\u2009=\\u2009879), and from the ITT population who received vedolizumab Q8W (n\\u2009=\\u2009276) or vedolizumab Q4W (n\\u2009=\\u2009279) during maintenance. Overall, the combined vedolizumab group included the 1434 patients who received vedolizumab during both the induction and maintenance phases. Patients in GEMINI 1 and GEMINI 2 were monitored for acute infusion-related reactions during and after infusions. Adverse events assessed by the investigator as infusion-related reactions were recorded.\\nVedolizumab has a half-life of ~\\u200925\\xa0days, and the week 66 time point was approximately 4.5 to 5 half-lives after the last dose of vedolizumab at week 50. Therefore, vedolizumab concentration was anticipated to be below the assay interference level, and this time point provided an opportunity to determine an “off-drug” rate for immunogenicity. Among patients with samples that had been previously analyzed by ELISA, samples from 2000 out of 2009 patients were available for reanalysis using the ECL assay (Table I).\\nThe impact of ADAs as a covariate that may affect clearance of vedolizumab was assessed using a previously reported population PK model that was reanalyzed with the GEMINI 1 and GEMINI 2 immunogenicity samples. The population PK analysis of the repeated measures was conducted using a qualified installation of Nonlinear Mixed Effects Modelling (NONMEM®), version 7.3 (ICON Development Solutions, Hanover, MD). The previous final population PK model was fit to the data using the full Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. The same Bayesian prior probability distributions that were specified in the previous model were used. In brief, informative priors were defined for maximum elimination rate (Vmax), concentration at half-maximum elimination rate (Km), peripheral volume of distribution (Vp), and intercompartmental clearance (Q), whereas uninformative (vague) priors were defined for the remaining fixed-effect parameters (structural PK parameters and covariate coefficients) and interindividual random-effect parameters in the model. Covariates included body weight, age, sex, serum albumin, vedolizumab ADA status, fecal calprotectin, disease activity scores (Crohn’s Disease Activity Index and Mayo score, both partial and complete), prior anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α treatment, disease (CD and UC), and adjuvant therapy (methotrexate, azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, and aminosalicylates). Pre- and post-processing of model input/output and analysis scripting was programmed using version 3.2.3 of R.\\nBanked samples from 2000 patients treated with placebo for induction and maintenance (n\\u2009=\\u2009295), vedolizumab for induction then placebo for maintenance (n\\u2009=\\u2009278), or vedolizumab for both induction and maintenance (n\\u2009=\\u20091427) were reanalyzed in this study (Table I). ADA status using the new, more drug-tolerant ECL assay is presented in Table II, and the results obtained using the ELISA are presented in Table III. Among the 1427 patients who received vedolizumab continuously during induction and maintenance and had an immunogenicity sample available, 86 (6%) were ADA-positive with the ECL assay at any time during or after study treatment; 66 were transiently ADA-positive and 20 persistently ADA-positive. Fifty-six patients (4%) developed neutralizing antibodies (Table II). At week 66, 45 of 310 patients (15%) had positive ADAs.\\nIn comparison, with the ELISA, 56 of 1434 patients (4%) who received vedolizumab continuously as part of GEMINI 1 or GEMINI 2 were ADA-positive. Of those 56 patients, 47 were transiently ADA-positive, 9 were persistently ADA-positive, and 33 were positive for neutralizing antibodies (Table III). At week 66, 32/320 (10%) patients with samples available for analysis were ADA-positive.\\nSimilar to a previous report using the ELISA for ADA detection, patients who only received 2 doses of vedolizumab during induction and then placebo during maintenance phase had the highest incidence of ADA-positive samples (Tables II and III). Using the ECL assay, 60 of 278 (22%) patients were ADA-positive at any time during or after study treatment; 12 patients were transiently ADA-positive, 48 were persistently ADA-positive, and 46 (17%) were positive for neutralizing antibodies (Table II). In comparison, the ELISA detected ADA-positive samples in 45 of 279 (16%) patients, among whom 14 were transiently ADA-positive, 31 were persistently ADA-positive, and 24 were positive for neutralizing antibodies (Table III).\\nFor patients (n\\u2009=\\u20091427) who had available results from both the ELISA and ECL assays, 1375 (96%) had similar ADA status, and 4% changed ADA status between the two assays (Table IV). Among the patients who showed differences in ADA status, 41 of 52 patients changed from negative by ELISA to positive by ECL assay, and 11 patients changed from positive by ELISA to negative by ECL assay. Of these 11 patients, 10 were transiently positive and only 1 was persistently positive by ELISA.\\nAmong the 1434 patients initially analyzed with ELISA and 1427 patients reanalyzed with ECL assay who were treated with vedolizumab during GEMINI 1 or GEMINI 2 induction and maintenance phases, 61 (4%) had an adverse event assessed by the investigator as an infusion-related reaction. With the ECL essay, 6 (10%) of these patients were ADA-positive, with 2 persistently ADA-positive (Table V). In comparison, with the ELISA, 3 of 61 (5%) patients were ADA-positive and all 3 were persistently ADA-positive (Table VI).\\nOf the 278 patients who received 2 doses of vedolizumab during the induction phase then placebo during the maintenance phase and tested with the ECL assay, 8 (3%) had infusion-related reactions, with 3 of the 8 (38%) ADA-positive, and 2 persistently-positive (Table V). In comparison, of the 279 patients tested with ELISA, only 1 of 8 (13%) was determined to be ADA-positive (Table VI).\\nIt was previously reported that the presence of ADA is associated with lower serum concentrations of vedolizumab. Therefore, trough serum vedolizumab concentrations were determined along with ADA status in 1713 patients who received at least 1 dose of vedolizumab in GEMINI 1 or GEMINI 2. At week 52, the median serum vedolizumab trough concentrations were 20.5\\xa0μg/mL, 18.4\\xa0μg/mL, and below the limit of quantitation for ADA-negative, transiently ADA-positive, and persistently ADA-positive patients with UC, respectively. For ADA-negative, transiently ADA-positive, and persistently ADA-positive patients with CD, the medians were 18.7\\xa0μg/mL, 9.6\\xa0μg/mL, and below the limit of quantitation, respectively. The drug tolerance of ADA ECL assay using the 100\\xa0ng/mL surrogate ADA-positive control is 25\\xa0μg/mL, which is greater than the median trough concentrations of vedolizumab observed in clinical trials. Therefore, the assay was able to detect the clinically relevant ADA as suggested by the FDA 2019 guidance.\\nSamples from all patients who received vedolizumab at any time during GEMINI 1 or GEMINI 2 were used to update the vedolizumab population PK model. The median age of the reanalysis patient population was 35.9\\xa0years of age (range, 17.7–77.7\\xa0years) and 48% were female. Patients had a median body weight of 68.3\\xa0kg (range, 28.0–172\\xa0kg), median albumin concentrations of 3.70\\xa0g/dL (range, 1.40–5.30\\xa0g/dL), and median fecal calprotectin concentrations of 731\\xa0mg/kg (range, 23.8–2.00e4\\xa0mg/kg). The median partial Mayo score of the 743 (43%) patients with UC was 6.0 (range, 1.0–9.0), and the median Crohn’s Disease Activity Index score for the 966 (57%) patients with CD was 321 (range, 93.0–548.0).\\nAs previously reported, body weight and serum albumin had an effect on vedolizumab linear clearance (CLL) variability with the potential to be clinically relevant. Also consistent with previous results obtained with ELISA showing an increase in CLL of 1.12 (95% credible interval (CDI), 1.05–1.20), the presence of ADA detected by the ECL assay was estimated to increase vedolizumab CLL by a factor of 1.10 (95% CDI, 1.03–1.17) (Table VII). With both models, the 95% CDI was statistically different from the null effect of 1. Further evaluation of covariate effects on CLL was conducted via simulation given Bayesian joint posterior distribution (or uncertainty) of the model parameters.\\nThe effect of covariates on vedolizumab CLL by disease state is shown in Fig.\\xa01. Covariate sizes of ±\\u200925% from the typical reference subject were used as a limit for clinically meaningful changes. Although there was a trend toward greater CLL with increased body weight for both the UC and CD cohorts, there was no clinically meaningful impact across the range of values evaluated. Similar observations were made for albumin except at the lowest value (median CLL, 1.5 [range, 1.41–1.59] and median CLL, 1.5 [range, 1.42–1.58] for both UC and CD, respectively). ADA positivity was not associated with a clinically significant change in CLL in either UC or CD patients, (the entire 95% CDI for the covariate effect fell within the ±\\u200925% limits).\\nWe report the results of a reanalysis of vedolizumab immunogenicity using new, more drug-tolerant, ECL-based assays for detection of anti-drug and neutralizing anti-drug antibodies. The availability of banked patient serum samples from the GEMINI 1 and GEMINI 2 trials offered a valuable opportunity to evaluate the new ECL assays on a large scale, compare the ECL results with those obtained using the traditional ELISA method, and reevaluate the effect of immunogenicity on vedolizumab PK and safety in inflammatory bowel disease.\\nThe acid dissociation ECL assay used in this study has a drug tolerance at least 100 times higher than the previous ELISA when using a 500\\xa0ng/mL surrogate ADA-positive control, thus allowing for detection of low-titer ADA. One limitation of this ECL assay is that due to its drug tolerance of ≤\\u200925\\xa0μg/mL of vedolizumab using a 100\\xa0ng/mL positive control, the presence of vedolizumab trough concentrations higher than 25\\xa0μg/mL may interfere with the detection of low-titer ADA (10\\xa0ng/mL). Patients may have a drug trough concentrations of >\\u200925\\xa0μg/mL during the induction phase of vedolizumab treatment. However, with the approved vedolizumab Q8W IV maintenance dosing schedule, patients are not expected to exceed drug trough concentrations of 25\\xa0μg/mL. Furthermore, the low positive control ADA concentration is 10-fold below the FDA-recommended levels of sensitivity and is likely not clinically relevant. Since vedolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody with no endogenous counterpart and it is not agonistic in function, this concentration poses a minimal risk to patient safety.\\nThe presence of ADAs and neutralizing ADAs was assessed in a cohort of 1427 patients with UC and CD treated with vedolizumab for up to 52\\xa0weeks. In this reanalysis of vedolizumab immunogenicity, the rate of ADAs in patients who received maintenance vedolizumab remained low with the ECL assay (6%) and with the ELISA (4%). With the new ECL assay, the rate of ADA positivity continued to be generally low across all subgroups. Rates ranged from 3% in patients who were randomized to placebo at both the induction and maintenance phases to 22% in patients who received vedolizumab during induction and were randomized to placebo at the maintenance phase, which was slightly higher than what was detected with the ELISA (range, 3%–16%). Of interest, the “off-drug” rate of immunogenicity at week 66 was 15% in the vedolizumab combined group by the ECL assay compared with 10% using the ELISA, suggesting the increased drug tolerance of the ECL assay was able to identify additional positive samples. The ECL assay also detected a higher proportion of samples with neutralizing ADAs.\\nBoth the ECL assay and the ELISA showed the highest incidence of ADA-positive individuals among patients who received vedolizumab at induction and then switched to placebo for maintenance. The reason for this observation is currently unknown. An elevated ADA-positivity rate following a drug holiday has been consistently observed with vedolizumab and other biologics used to treat inflammatory bowel disease. It has been suggested that this may be a result of the presence of less drug to interfere with ADA assays resulting in a better detection rate. However, the observed similar ADA incident rate by the more drug-tolerant ECL assay suggests factors other than drug interference might have contributed to this observation. Previous reports showed that higher ADA levels with episodic or interrupted biologic treatment as compared with continuous treatment are accompanied by decreased treatment benefit. Some reports suggested lower immunogenicity in the continuous treatment groups due to the induction of immunotolerance by maintaining a trough vedolizumab concentration, or the paradoxical suppression of the immune response.\\nThe ADA status of most (96%) patients remained unchanged between ELISA and the ECL assay. Changing from ADA-negative by ELISA to ADA-positive by ECL assay was most likely due to improved assay drug tolerance, while changing from positive by ELISA to negative by ECL was most likely due to bioanalytical assay variation in detecting lower levels of antibody titers near the assay cut point. These results demonstrate that the two assays have general agreement but may differ in the presence of low levels of ADA.\\nInfusion-related reactions were infrequent in the GEMINI studies and were reported in only 61 out of 1434 patients initially analyzed with ELISA and 1427 patients reanalyzed with ECL assay who received vedolizumab maintenance treatment. While ADAs were detected in more patients with infusion reactions using the ECL assay than with the ELISA, the overall rate remained low (10% versus 5%), suggesting that immunogenicity is not a large driver of infusion reactions with vedolizumab.\\nBased on week 52 median vedolizumab trough concentrations, persistent ADA-positive antibodies as detected using both the ECL assay and the ELISA were associated with decreased vedolizumab serum concentrations. The results of vedolizumab CLL covariate analyses were consistent with previous reports and showed a trend for body weight and serum albumin to affect CLL, although the difference only reached clinical relevance (±\\u200925%) at the lowest albumin concentration. Similar to ADA outcomes generated with the ELISA, the presence of ADAs as detected using the ECL assay was determined to be not clinically relevant, as the entire 95% CDI fell within the predetermined ±\\u200925% limits.\\nIn conclusion, this re-analysis of vedolizumab immunogenicity in serum samples from a very large cohort of patients with UC or CD confirmed that immunogenicity results obtained using new, drug-tolerant ECL assays remain generally consistent with those obtained using ELISA. While the ECL assays detected slightly more ADA-positive patients than did the ELISA, these new ECL results support the conclusions established with ELISA that vedolizumab immunogenicity is low and has a minimal effect on vedolizumab PK or safety in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.\\nAll authors had access to the study data; contributed to manuscript drafting, critical review, and revision; and approved the final version of the article, including the authorship list.\\nThis study was sponsored by Takeda.

       "    'fulltext': 'Vedolizumab is a biologic already licensed to treat other conditions including inflammatory bowel disease.\\nThis is the first study to employ a range of vedolizumab doses to assess safety, tolerability and best anti-HIV activity effect in the context of chronic HIV infection.\\nThis study will assess the safety of vedolizumab using analytical treatment interruptions up to and beyond 12 weeks’ duration, which may be essential to assessing the anti-HIV activity effects of this therapy.\\nNon-human primate studies use significantly higher doses of anti-α4β7 integrin mAb than the highest licensed human dose of 300\\u2009mg/infusion of vedolizumab (~4\\u2009mg/kg); however, safety outcomes at this maximum licensed dose in this population will be needed before higher-dose arms can be assessed.\\nLarger-scale clinical trials will be needed to confirm any anti-HIV activity observed in this pilot trial.\\nHIV is a chronic active infection of leucocytes resulting in a progressive and profound depletion of lymphocytes, and ultimately in AIDS. Newly infected cells may undergo lytic productive infection on activation (lymphocytes) or undergo chronic productive infection (macrophages). In addition, an infected lymphocyte may remain dormant with latent, integrated HIV infection, which expands the latent reservoir of infected cells. Continuous antiretroviral therapy (ART) suppresses HIV viraemia and allows some degree of immune healing, so as to permit near-normal health and life expectancy. However, ART is not a cure for HIV infection. ART interruption is nearly always followed by rebound of plasma viral load (pVL) to the pre-treatment viraemia levels, referred to as the viral set point, followed by resumption of progressive immunodeficiency.\\nA promising finding of sustained virological remission of pVL (SVR) and stable CD4 cell count was reported in Science by Dr Byrareddy and colleagues in a rhesus macaque Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV) infection model. SIV (and HIV) appears to preferentially infect CD4+ T lymphocytes expressing α4β7 integrin, a lymphocyte homing receptor for trafficking to gut mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) that was the target of mAb therapy in this study. This anti-α4β7 mAb was administered serially every 3\\u2009weeks at 50\\u2009mg/kg for eight doses to acutely infected macaques on ART and was followed by ATI and subsequent discontinuation of mAb administration. SVR and low GALT-associated VLs for 24 months was observed in eight of eleven animals, after a low-level pVL rebound in five of the eight. In these animals, subsequent iatrogenic CD8 T-cell depletion resulted in viral rebound, indicating control but not eradication of virus (Byrareddy, unpublished). The mechanism of this post-treatment control is unknown, and later attempts to replicate this finding have been unsuccessful. One small human trial of vedolizumab in HIV infection did not observe SVR, but was limited in its ability to detect post-rebound suppression. In human HIV infection, SVR over time without evidence of progressive immunodeficiency in the absence of ART would meet definitional criteria of a ‘functional cure’, where pVL suppression is maintained without ART and without eradication of virus.\\nHumanised anti-α4β7 integrin mAb (vedolizumab, Entyvio) is a licensed treatment for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Vedolizumab has a safety record of 4811 person-years observation, in which 2830 patients received vedolizumab from one to 1977 (median 328) days, during which there was no increased risk of any infections (<1% overall for tuberculosis (TB) or other serious infection), and no reported case of progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy (PML), compared with placebo and standard non-biological therapy. Modelling shows that cumulative exposure to vedolizumab still has a very low risk of PML compared with other biologics such as natalizumab that non-selectively targets α4 integrin.\\nA human clinical trial of anti-α4β7 integrin monoclonal antibody is feasible, given that a safe humanised product is available. A pilot study to assess the translation of this intervention’s anti-HIV effects from a non-human primate model to humans is needed to inform the design of larger trials. We describe a dose-finding and exposure-finding pilot trial in healthy adults with ART-treated chronic HIV infection to assess vedolizumab safety and anti-HIV activity or SVR after ATI. This trial proposal is of a short duration (~1\\u2009year) and simple design to assess short-term safety and tolerance of vedolizumab according to dose. It will also assess whether pVL rebound and/or SVR occurs after ATI, in relation to dose, duration and systemic exposure to vedolizumab.\\nIn planning novel HIV treatment strategies, a combination of approaches will be necessary in order to address all aspects of HIV infection including the active, latent and concealed reservoirs of persistent infection. The anticipated mechanism of possible SVR with short-term vedolizumab intervention is not eradication or a virological cure, but a functional cure with immunological-maintained viral suppression in absence of ART and after withdrawal of the intervention. This trial design accommodates the collection and cryopreservation of biological specimens (sera, plasma, peripheral blood lymphocytes, rectal biopsy samples, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and stool) that will permit mechanistic immunological and virological studies in the event that treatment effects are seen.\\nIn the macaque model, a mAb against α4β7 integrin was used at a dose of 50\\u2009mg/kg per infusion, with infusions given every 3 weeks. In humans, 300\\u2009mg per infusion given every 4 to 8 weeks is the highest licensed dose of vedolizumab (equivalent to 4\\u2009mg/kg/infusion in a 70\\u2009kg adult) and therefore was the highest dose used in this study protocol. A dose reduction in sequential groups will be implemented to assess for a dose-related treatment effect on pVL rebound kinetics or SVR. As compared with the existing human study by Sneller et al, our protocol provides the majority of vedolizumab doses after ATI, with only initial loading occurring before ATI. Ongoing vedolizumab exposure after treatment interruption is hypothesised to be important for the development of remission and is more in keeping with the original animal model.\\nThe primary outcomes will be (1) the safety and tolerability of vedolizumab treatment at different doses in seven infusions as defined by the incidence of adverse events (AEs) and pre-specified side effects, and (2) the incidence and (3) duration of pVL remission during and after vedolizumab treatment following ATI determined by serial measurement of pVL.\\nThe secondary outcomes will be (1) the incidence and (2) magnitude of pVL rebound after ATI during and after treatment with vedolizumab, (3) the success of re-suppression of pVL with ART in the event of recurrent sustained pVL, and (4) the kinetics of pVL and CD4 T lymphocyte count during the study period.\\nHAVARTI is a single-arm, dose-ranging pilot trial of serial vedolizumab infusions for the induction of HIV SVR in adults with chronic HIV infection on ART. Twelve consenting volunteers respecting all inclusion and exclusion criteria will be enrolled sequentially in groups of four to receive vedolizumab by infusion in 2-week to 4-week intervals for a total of seven doses. After three doses of vedolizumab, the participants will initiate the ATI portion of the study. During the ATI, participants will discontinue ART but continue with the four remaining scheduled vedolizumab treatments and monitoring of pVL and immunological markers. They will also have regular clinical assessment at each infusion visit. Participants will restart ART according to CD4 T-cell count and pVL threshold levels and trajectory, personal choice, or consensus judgement of the volunteer patient, treating physician and/or study investigators. Decisions to continue ATI or restart ART in the presence of CD4, pVL and clinical indicators will be reviewed by an independent expert medical monitor and reported to the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) in a timely manner.\\nStudy participants will be recruited from The Ottawa Hospital (TOH) HIV clinic and referring primary care facilities. Informed consent will be obtained from those patients who are documented to be eligible for the trial after pre-screening. Table 1 shows the safety laboratory tests and concomitant medication surveys to be done during screening. Individuals who wish to discuss enrolment in the trial with family, partner, friends or their treating physician may take the time and choose to enrol at a subsequent clinic visit. Once enrolled, the participant will be followed concomitantly by the principal investigator and study staff at TOH for the duration of the trial.\\nParticipants will meet the following criteria to be eligible for entry into the study: (1) documented HIV infection by Western blot or confirmatory enzyme immunoassay with documented pre-ART pVL; (2) be aged 18–65 years; (3) have received ART for between 2 and 10 years; (4) have no other significant comorbidity; (5) are receiving no other immune-modulating treatments; (6) have well-controlled HIV infection as defined by stable pVL of <50 copies/mL and CD4 counts >500\\u2009cells/µL with nadir CD4 counts >200\\u2009cells/µL. Adults may be male, female or transgender.\\nPatients who meet any of the following criteria will be ineligible to participate: (1) women who are pregnant or lactating; (2) those who are non-adherent with contraception and safer sex practices; (3) patients with a history of AIDS-defining illness, drug-resistant HIV or treatment-refractory pVL response; (4) those with a history of non-adherence to ART; (5) current co-infection with hepatitis B or C; (6) current untreated TB including latent TB; (7) past HIV or non-HIV related autoimmune disease requiring immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive therapy.\\nThe study schedule is represented in table 1 and figure 1. At the screening visit, participants will be assessed for study inclusion with respect to inclusion and exclusion criteria. A physical examination will be performed, a medical history will be taken and any laboratory testing not available from the patient record will be collected. Screening laboratory tests include haematology values (complete blood cell counts (CBCs), differential white blood cell counts, erythrocyte sedimentation rate), serum chemistry, markers of HIV (pVL, CD4 lymphocyte count and percentage, CD4:CD8 ratio) and a urine dipstick pregnancy test where indicated. Those meeting eligibility criteria after screening will be consented by the investigators and will return for a baseline visit (within 1–12 weeks of screening).\\nRegular study visits, as per table 1, will entail a history, physical examination, safety assessment and laboratory studies. In addition to the regular study visits, blood draws and AE assessments will be performed between weeks 6 and 7, at the time of ATI. Optional specimen collection to be performed in willing participants includes (1) stool samples prior to treatment initiation (baseline or week 0), 24 and 52 weeks after initiation for microbiome assessment; (2) rectal mucosal biopsies prior to treatment initiation and at 24 weeks and 52 weeks after initiation for assessment of HIV pro-viral DNA by PCR in GALT; and (3) CSF samples at 24 and 52 weeks after treatment initiation for characterisation of the lymphocyte populations and VL in the event of pVL remission after ATI. Unscheduled visits will be performed in the event of new neurological symptoms suspicious for PML or treatment side effects.\\nAs seen in table 1, each participant is studied for 52 weeks. Study recruitment for the highest dose began late 2017 and follow-up continued to March 2019, when the study was interrupted for an amendment. The trial then resumed recruitment late 2019 with active treatment and follow-up continuing at this time. New recruitment has been postponed due to COVID-19 restrictions and therefore will likely resume in 2021.\\nFigure 1 shows the study schedule and table 1 shows the study visit schedule. Twelve HIV-infected adults on suppressive ART meeting all inclusion and exclusion criteria will be enrolled sequentially in groups of four to receive three different doses of vedolizumab (300\\u2009mg, 150\\u2009mg, 75\\u2009mg) by infusion for a total of seven doses at intervals as recommended for ulcerative colitis (weeks 0, 2, 5, 8, 12, 16 and 20). Participants will undergo an ATI of their regular ART at weeks 6–7 (figure 1), with the duration of ATI being up to 48 weeks, or until sustained viraemia or immune dysfunction is documented (see re-treatment parameters below). After completion of the study protocol, patients will be seen quarterly or as needed according to pVL response and/or ART re-treatment status and response according to standard clinical practice.\\nThreshold criteria for clinical consideration of ART re-initiation will include (1) sustained recurrence of HIV viraemia, (2) confirmed absolute CD4 count below 350\\u2009cells/µL or by more than 10% from pre-ART baseline CD4 value, or (3) development of an AIDS-defining or related illness. Following ATI, sustained recurrence of HIV viraemia will be defined by confirmation by repeat testing of (1) pVL reaching ≥0.5\\u2009log of the patient’s viraemia peak prior to ART and (2) pVL rebound extending beyond a period of 12 weeks from initial detection after ATI. If sustained viraemia is observed after ATI, ART may be re-initiated and participants monitored until pVL suppression is re-established. Study visits as per the study schedule will continue in these patients. The decision to re-initiate ART is a personal choice of the participant and non-study advisors, the trial investigators and staff, or an experienced and independent medical judgement on the aggregate of timely clinical and laboratory information at hand, with the interests of the patient primarily in mind.\\nParticipants may withdraw from the study for any reason at any time. Participants may also be withdrawn by the investigator due to an AE which would in the judgement of the investigator require discontinuation of study product or re-initiation of ART, or for non-compliance with the study protocol. Participants who withdraw from the study will be asked to follow up either with the study physician or their regular HIV physician.\\nThis is an exploratory pilot study of 12 HIV-infected adult volunteers, which will permit observation of the incidence, degree and duration of virological rebound and remission following vedolizumab treatment across ATI. SVR in the absence of ART is rarely observed. If this effect can be repeatedly demonstrated in response to the intervention, the outcome would be remarkable and clinically meaningful. For this study, a small sample size is sufficient to observe such a categorical effect on virological rebound and SVR following vedolizumab treatment.\\nVirological rebound will be compared with individual patients’ pre-ART pVL measures and with historical controls consisting of participants having undergone ATI in other reported trials. Mean and median levels of pVL rebound will be compared with steady-state pre-treatment levels using standard statistical tests, analogous to pharmacokinetic parameters.\\nSafety laboratory measures will include a CBC, white blood cell differential, electrolytes, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and serum chemistry (albumin, alanine transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, amylase, aspartate transaminase, bilirubin (total), blood glucose (random), blood urea nitrogen, calcium, chloride, C reactive protein, creatinine, gamma-glutamyl transferase, potassium, protein (total), and sodium).\\nA pre-ART pVL will need to be obtained from the patient chart as part of study inclusion. HIV pVL will be assayed using the Abbott HIV 1 Viral Load Assay at indicated study visits. CSF may be collected from consenting participants at week 24 (end of vedolizumab treatment, during ATI) and week 52 for viral load assay in the event of pVL suppression, or if lumbar puncture for CSF is otherwise clinically indicated according to an AE.\\nHIV reservoirs will be measured in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) by viral outgrowth assay and HIV DNA by PCR.\\nMononuclear cells will be isolated from rectal mucosal biopsy samples scheduled to be taken before vedolizumab treatment, and after ATI in cases with post-ATI suppression of pVL. DNA will be isolated from a fixed number of cells and subjected to PCR analysis and expressed as the number of copies per nanogram of host DNA.\\nRoutine CD4 and CD8 T-cell counts will be performed on whole blood using standard flow cytometric analysis. Flow cytometry will be performed on freshly isolated PBMCs and mononuclear cells isolated from peripheral blood, and the rectal mucosal biopsy samples to evaluate relative expression of levels of CD45A, CCR7 and CD27 to determine percentages of naïve, central memory, preterminal effector memory, transitional memory and terminally differentiated CD4+ and\\u2009CD8+ T-lymphocyte subsets as previously described. The expression of activation markers such as HLA-DR and CD38 will also be assessed by flow cytometry.\\nSerum samples taken over the course of the trial (each study visit starting at week 0) will be taken and cryopreserved for future measurement of vedolizumab levels, for anti-drug antibodies (ADA) and for neutralising ADA.\\nIn addition to HIV reservoir quantification, immunohistochemical staining and standard histopathological microscopic examination will be performed on biopsy specimens.\\nNucleic acid probe testing will be performed on frozen stool samples collected at three intervals (week 0, week 24 and week 52) for characterisation of the human faecal microbiome.\\nFrozen plasma samples collected at each study visit and stored at −80°C may be assayed for changes in specific inflammatory cytokines (eg, IFN-α, IL-1, IL-6, IP-10, TNF-α and LPS) pre-study and post-study intervention by ELISA.\\nAEs are defined as any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered to be related to the medicinal product; and/or pre-existing symptoms or conditions which worsen during a study.\\nInformation about all AEs and severe AEs will be recorded and followed for resolution. In this trial, there will be vigilance for infusion-related AEs.\\nTo enhance patient safety, and to comply with the Health Canada Food and Drug regulations programme and Good Clinical Practice, an independent DSMB has been established for this trial. The DSMB will be informed and review safety and activity data, and will raise questions or instruct on protocol performance and outcomes.\\nAn Ottawa Hospital Research Institute (OHRI) Internal Monitor will conduct a monitoring visit shortly after enrolment commences. This monitoring by OHRI does not replace the routine quality control to be performed by the investigator or designee. Routine quality assurance will be completed by an assigned monitor to ensure that the study is being conducted according to the protocol and the monitoring plan.\\nCancure community advisory members were consulted during the design process and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research Canadian HIV Trials Network (CTN) Community Advisory Committee was involved in reviewing the study prior to a funding decision. We planned and did engage our study volunteers in the communication of interim and preliminary study results, and the planning of any needed protocol amendments during the trial.\\nThe study protocol and informed consent documents have been approved by the Ottawa Health Science Network-REB (#20160928) and by the Health Canada Therapeutic Products Directorate (#HC6-024-c206120). Written informed consent will be obtained from all participants. The study will be conducted in accordance with Health Canada regulations, the International Conference on Harmonisation guidelines on current Good Clinical Practice and the Declaration of Helsinki. Patient recruitment has begun and continues.\\nResults will be disseminated through scientific peer-reviewed publications, national and international conferences, and the CTN according to CONSORT (Consolidated Standards on Reporting Trials) and SPIRIT (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials) guidelines.\\nThe report of sustained SIV remission in rhesus macaques treated with an anti-α4β7 mAb is the foundation on which the HAVARTI trial was developed. The present study will aim to determine if vedolizumab, the humanised anti-α4β7 mAb available on the Canadian market, is safe for healthy HIV-infected adults at a licensed or permitted dosage. In addition, the goal is to assess vedolizumab for SVR after ATI. Towards these goals, several design elements were taken into special consideration during the development of the HAVARTI trial, with an effort to closely follow the macaque study while keeping the safety of the participants primarily in mind.\\nThe HAVARTI trial is designed as a single-arm, dose-ranging pilot trial. No placebo control arm will be used because (1) this is an exploratory pilot study of a novel investigational agent; (2) pVL rebound occurs reliably after analytical or other ART interruption, and the SVR outcome of interest is not a small effect; and (3) in small trials, neither randomisation nor controls may protect from large expected biases related to biological variation. Placebo controls from an Ottawa/Montreal randomised controlled trial of therapeutic HIV vaccination using ALVAC with or without Remune experienced a median time to viral rebound of ~2\\u2009weeks after ATI and will be used as a historical control for comparison, among other more recent reports and studies.\\nATI, the intentional interruption of suppressive ART to assess an investigational product’s ability to induce virological control, remains the gold standard for investigation of novel therapies for HIV cure research. Although the SMART study conducted in the context of clinical management research showed that participants who interrupted ART were at higher risk of developing AIDS and non-AIDS events compared with those who did not interrupt ART, it also revealed that ATI can be done safely when the individual has suppressed plasma viraemia (pVL <50 copies/mL), high current CD4 count (>500\\u2009cells/µL) and high CD4 nadir (>200\\u2009cells/µL), in the context of a carefully monitored trial. Therefore, participants in the HAVARTI trial will be screened for these inclusion criteria to decrease risks associated with ART interruption in a different context. Furthermore, successful re-initiation of ART and suppression of pVL is a priority, so prospective study participants will not have a history of drug-resistant HIV, treatment-refractory pVL response or non-adherence to ART. Certain HLA phenotypes have been shown to be protective and prevent viral rebound following ATI and therefore HLA typing should be performed if any controller phenotypes emerge following vedolizumab treatment.\\nThe rationale behind threshold criteria and judgement for re-initiation of ART stems from the rhesus macaque model, where ATI was followed by initial rebound of SIV pVL in most animals before subsequent sustained remission was achieved. If vedolizumab has the same effect in HIV-infected humans, it is hypothesised that there may be a similar short-term pVL rebound prior to SVR. Re-initiation of ART at first detection of pVL rebound would prevent detection of subsequent, perhaps immunologically mediated, SVR.\\nWhile the present trial is modelled on the macaque study, there are some notable differences in the dosing regimen. Primatised anti-α4β7 mAb has Fc-receptor avid Fc-fragment, whereas vedolizumab is a masking antibody, without Fc-receptor avidity. Macaques were infused with 50\\u2009mg/kg of α4β7 mAb; in this study, the highest vedolizumab dose is 300\\u2009mg per infusion, about 4\\u2009mg/kg for a 70\\u2009kg adult. Pharmacokinetic studies in humans showed saturation of peripheral blood lymphocyte target receptors at doses as low as 0.2\\u2009mg/kg, with robust saturation at doses of 2\\u2009mg/kg. Vedolizumab is shown to be clinically effective for IBD at doses of 0.5–2 mg/kg, with 300\\u2009mg per infusion being the recommended dose for patients with IBD. The half-life of vedolizumab is 18–25.5\\u2009days  versus a half-life of 11.4 days for the α4β7 mAb used in the macaque study; therefore, after initial loading of three doses over 5 weeks, the regular dosing interval is 4 weeks for this study as compared with 3 weeks in the macaque study. Finally, participants will receive seven infusions of vedolizumab instead of the eight received by macaques. In the macaque study, pVL suppression was evident by 6 weeks after ATI in all treated animals. Viral rebound occurred within 2 weeks in five of eight animals and was subsequently re-suppressed within 4 weeks. Virological control was therefore robust throughout the remaining α4β7 mAb treatments and after its discontinuation. The number of necessary infusions is unclear; however, data from the macaque model suggest that immunological control developed early after withdrawal of ART, and that ongoing mAb therapy after viral suppression may not be necessary.\\nAnother difference between the macaque study and our participant population is the chronicity of infection prior to ART treatment and duration of suppressive ART. Macaques were infected with SIV 5 weeks before initiation of ART, the equivalent of treatment during primary HIV infection (PHI). For the present human trial, we are recruiting participants who are chronically infected with HIV and on suppressive ART for 2–10 years. Most people living with HIV (PLWH) are not diagnosed during primary infection. Meaningful impact in HIV cure research requires interventions accessible to this majority population who have chronic HIV infection on effective ART.\\nDesign of the HAVARTI protocol aims to maximally protect study participants from developing ADA. In the macaque study, 3 of 11 animals developed antibodies against the α4β7 mAb. However, these animals were excluded from analysis and the effect of ADA on HIV treatment efficacy remains uncertain. The GEMINI trials demonstrated a 4% immunogenicity rate for patients with IBD who received continuous vedolizumab treatment, with rates of persistent positive antibody and neutralising antibodies at 0.6% and 2.3%, respectively. However, the immunogenicity rate was 10% when patients were off vedolizumab treatment, suggesting the rate may have been underestimated due to decreased ability to detect low to moderate ADA titres during continuous treatment. Since ADA development is more likely for low-level and intermittent exposure, this study is designed with short dosing intervals to avoid recurrent prolonged periods of low mAb levels.\\nPLWH are required to take daily ART indefinitely. The SIV239-infected rhesus macaques that were functionally cured by treatment with ART and a mAb against α4β7 integrin give us hope that a similar functional cure could be possible for PLWH. This is the first study to employ a clinical trial design involving multiple dosing arms to assess safety, tolerability and best anti-HIV effect of vedolizumab in the context of chronic HIV infection. A licensed drug such as vedolizumab with a novel anti-HIV mechanism of action would be of great clinical interest in the pursuit of HIV cure.'},\n",

       "    'fulltext': 'Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic disabling condition with a prevalence of up to 0.5% of the general population in the Western world. It is estimated that approximately 25% of female patients with IBD conceive after the diagnosis is made. Although the course of the disease during pregnancy generally mirrors that of the nonpregnant IBD population, active IBD in pregnant women has been associated with an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes including increased rates of spontaneous abortion, preterm delivery, low birth weight, and severe preeclampsia, as well as increased likelihood of delivery by cesarean. Women with active disease at conception also have a higher risk of ongoing disease activity during pregnancy. Maintaining adequate disease control during pregnancy is, therefore, essential to ensuring favorable maternal and neonatal outcomes.\\nPoor treatment compliance among pregnant women with IBD can stem from a lack of awareness of the harmful effects of IBD exacerbation during pregnancy and an overestimation of the harmful effects of medication. In reality, active IBD is high risk to the mother and developing fetus and the benefit of disease treatment may outweigh the risks. Biologics such as anti–tumor necrosis factor α (anti-TNFα) and anti-integrin agents are important treatment options for patients with IBD. Although many of these agents are known to cross the placenta at the end of the second trimester and after delivery, use of biologics for the management of IBD during pregnancy is considered low risk, with no evidence of an increased risk of unfavorable pregnancy outcomes. The ongoing prospective, multicenter Pregnancy in IBD and Neonatal Outcomes (PIANO) registry, with an enrollment of approximately 1,500 women in the United States, is providing insight into the safety of biologic medicines in pregnant women with IBD. Analyses from PIANO have reported that the use of vedolizumab, a biologic, was not associated with an increase in adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as congenital abnormalities or abnormal infant growth and development, or infant infection rates. Furthermore, in utero exposure to biologics did not have an impact on infant developmental milestones or affect infant response to vaccines. However, the long-term implications of in utero exposure to biologics, especially with respect to immune system development and function, are currently unknown.\\nImmunoglobulin G (IgG) is actively transported from mother to fetus across the placenta by the neonatal Fc receptor FcRn. This process begins at week 16 of gestation, but the majority of IgG is acquired by the fetus during the last 4 weeks of pregnancy. Placental transfer of the IgG1 anti-TNFα agents adalimumab and infliximab is well-documented; however, certolizumab pegol, an IgG1 anti-TNFα agent which lacks an Fc region, is not actively transported across the placenta. Placental transfer of natalizumab, a humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody against the α4-integrin cell adhesion molecule, has also been reported. Labels for adalimumab, infliximab, and certolizumab pegol state that women should inform their health-care provider if they are pregnant or plan on becoming pregnant because the agent will harm the unborn baby. The natalizumab label categorizes pregnancy as a specific population, indicating that use may cause fetal harm based on animal data.\\nVedolizumab, a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody approved for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis or Crohn disease, targets α4β7 integrin and selectively blocks gut-specific lymphocyte trafficking. According to the drug prescribing information, vedolizumab should be used during pregnancy only if the benefits outweigh any potential risks to both the mother and the fetus. The timing and mechanisms of placental transfer of vedolizumab are expected to be similar to that of other IgG1 antibodies, and in a small number of vedolizumab-treated patients included in PIANO registry, placental transfer of vedolizumab has been confirmed. Data for vedolizumab during pregnancy are currently limited. The largest report comes from Mahadevan et al, which described pregnancy outcomes among 24 pregnancies in females with IBD and 15 pregnancies in partners of males who were exposed to vedolizumab in clinical trials, as well as 81 pregnancies from postmarketing safety data. Although a single congenital abnormality was documented in a clinical trial, this was not deemed to be vedolizumab treatment related, and the data do not indicate safety concerns related to pregnancy outcomes with vedolizumab.\\nTo further characterize the preclinical safety profile of vedolizumab, embryo–fetal and postnatal developmental studies were conducted to evaluate the potential of vedolizumab to induce maternal or developmental effects after gestational exposure in preclinical animal models. Pregnant rabbits were administered vedolizumab to assess maternal toxicity and fetal development. Cynomolgus monkeys were treated from gestational day (GD) 20 to GD 140 to evaluate the effects of vedolizumab on pregnancy, parturition, and lactation in mothers, as well on the survival, growth, and postnatal development of the offspring.\\nAnimal protocols for both studies were reviewed and approved by an institutional review panel (Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee).\\nThis study was conducted in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonisation Tripartite Guideline on Detection of Toxicity to Reproduction for Medicinal Products, Federal Register (September 22, 1994; Section 4.1.3) and the appropriate provisions of the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) regulations (21 CFR Part 58).\\nTimed-mated, female, young adult to adult (5-9 months of age at study initiation), New Zealand white rabbits (n = 25 per group) were obtained from Covance Research Products, Inc (Kalamazoo, Michigan) and housed in WIL Research Laboratories (Ashland, Ohio), a facility that is fully accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International. Vedolizumab was administered as a single intravenous (IV) infusion at doses of 0 mg/kg (saline control), 10 mg/kg (human equivalent dose [HED]: 3.2 mg/kg), 30 mg/kg (HED: 9.7 mg/kg), or 100 mg/kg (HED: 32.3 mg/kg; Supplemental Table 1) via the marginal ear vein on GD 7; previous preclinical data demonstrated that a single infusion at the proposed doses resulted in clinically relevant vedolizumab exposure for up to 14 days. An infusion time of 60 minutes was chosen to minimize stress from prolonged restraint while optimizing the flow rate needed for infusion into the marginal ear vein. Additional rabbits were used for the toxicokinetic (TK) phase (n = 3 per group). Blood samples for quantification of analytes of interest were collected prior to dosing (0 hour), at the end of the infusion, and at 48, 168, and 337 hours after the end of the infusion.\\nMaternal body weight (BW) was recorded on GD 0, 4, 6 to 21 daily, 24, and 29; gravid uterine weight, net BW, and net BW change data were collected on GD 29; and food consumption was recorded on GD 4 to 29. Vedolizumab in serum was quantified via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; mean peak serum vedolizumab concentration [Cmax], time to maximum concentration [Tmax], and area under the concentration–time curve from 0 to 337 hours after infusion [AUC0-337h]). On GD 7, at predose and 312 hours postdose, approximately 0.75 mL of whole blood was collected from the marginal ear vein for the measurement of rabbit antihuman (anti-vedolizumab) antibodies (RAHA). The blood samples for serum concentrations of vedolizumab and RAHA were processed into serum at room temperature and held on dry ice until stored at approximately −70°C. Serum samples were shipped on dry ice from WIL Research Laboratories, LLC, to Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc (Cambridge, Massachusetts). Blood samples were shipped directly to Millennium at room temperature for flow cytometry analysis to measure free α4β7 sites and bound vedolizumab on peripheral blood B and T cells. Qualitative determination of CD4+ T cells staining positive for free α4β7 sites and bound vedolizumab after infusion was evaluated by flow cytometry.\\nAll rabbits were euthanized on GD 29. Postmortem end points included the number of fetuses, early and late resorptions, and pre- and postimplantation loss. Examinations of viable fetuses included BW and the appearance of the external body, the viscera, and a mid-coronal slice of the head. All external, visceral, and skeletal findings were recorded as developmental variations (alterations in anatomic structure considered to have no significant biological effect on animal health or body conformity or to occur at high incidence, representing slight deviations from normal) or malformations (structural abnormalities that alter general body conformity, disrupt or interfere with normal body function, or may be incompatible with life).\\nThis study was conducted at Covance Laboratories (Münster, Germany) in compliance with the GLP Regulations as outlined in German Chemical Law, annex 1 to §19a Chemikalien Gesetz, June 2002, the OECD Principles of GLP (revised 1997, issued January 1998) ENV/MC/CHEM (98),17, and the Consensus Document “The Application of the OECD Principles of GLP to the Organisation and Management of Multi-Site Studies” ENV/JM/MONO (2002)9. The study was conducted under compliance of these regulations and standards, fully met GLP regulations, and was acceptable to US FDA regulatory authorities.\\nSexually mature female monkeys at least 3 years of age were purpose bred. Female monkeys were housed individually in a climate-controlled room with a minimum of 10 air changes/hour and artificial lighting controlled on a 12-hour light–dark cycle; enrichment was provided in each cage. Pregnancy was confirmed by ultrasound at postcoital days 18 to 20. Continuation of pregnancies was confirmed by ultrasound on GD 30, 44, 58, 72, 86, 100, 128, 142, and 156 (± 1 day); BWs were monitored on GD 19, 26, 33, 40, 47, 54, 61, 68, 75, 82, 89, 96, 103, 110, 117, 124, 131, 138, 145, 152, and 159 (± 1 day).\\nVedolizumab was administered IV every 2 weeks (Q2W) to 36 nonfasted pregnant cynomolgus monkeys starting at GD 20 (total of 9 infusions given over 20-30 minutes on GD 20, 34, 48, 62, 76, 90, 104, 118, and 132). Mothers were randomly assigned to groups receiving doses of 0 mg/kg (saline control), 10 mg/kg (expected maximum human dose), or 100 mg/kg vedolizumab (10-fold the expected maximum human dose; Supplemental Table 1). Pregnant females delivered their offspring who were then monitored for 6 months. Maternal BWs in the postpartum period were recorded on postpartum days (PPD) 1, 7, 14, 21, and 28 and then at monthly intervals for up to 6 months. In addition, food consumption, excretions, and pelage were monitored regularly during the lactation period. Mothers and infants were euthanized on PPD 181 ± 1.\\nToxicokinetic assessments were conducted on serum from blood collected on GD 20, GD 132, postcoital day 277, and the day of planned necropsy of the infant (PPD 181 ± 1). In addition, breast milk was collected on PPD 28 ± 1 to determine vedolizumab concentration by direct ELISA. Mothers were monitored for clinical signs, morbidity and mortality, pregnancy status, and BW (Supplementary Table 2). Blood sample collection for primate anti-human antibody (PAHA) analysis was scheduled at the same time as that for TK assessments and evaluated by direct ELISA. Pharmacodynamic (PD) assessments (vedolizumab bound to α4β7 integrin in peripheral blood T cells by flow cytometry assays) were conducted on serum samples from blood collected as per the TK assessments. Hematology and clinical assessments included blood counts and standard blood chemistries.\\nToxicokinetic assessments were conducted on blood samples collected on PPD 28 ± 1, PPD 120, and on necropsy (PPD 181 ± 1) to determine vedolizumab concentration by ELISA. Infants were sexed on day 1 and then examined for external abnormalities on PPD 1, 7, 14, 21, and 28 and then at monthly intervals for up to 6 months. Morphologic examinations were performed on PPD 1, 21, 50, 88, and 180 (±1 day). A neurobehavioral test battery was performed on PPD 1 and 7, and grip strength evaluation was conducted on PPD 28 (Supplementary Table 3). Blood samples were also collected on PPD 28 and 120 and at necropsy (PPD 181 ± 1); these were evaluated for PAHA concentration by ELISA and utilized for PD assessments (vedolizumab bound to α4β7 integrin in peripheral blood CD4+/CD45AR− T cells by flow cytometry assays). Full external and internal examinations were made of the infant monkeys following euthanasia.\\nFor the rabbit study, maternal BWs, BW changes, food consumption, gravid uterine weights, numbers of corpora lutea, implantation sites, viable fetuses, and fetal BWs were analyzed by 1-way parametric analysis of variance (ANOVA) to determine intragroup differences with a threshold of P < 0.05 to conclude significance. This analysis was followed by performing Dunnett tests to compare BWs between the vedolizumab treatment groups and the vehicle control group. No statistical analyses were performed on the serum concentration data or derived PK, PD, or RAHA parameters.\\nFor the monkey study, maternal BWs, net maternal weight gain, infant BWs, infant organ weights, hematology data, clinical chemistry data, and organ weights were analyzed by ANOVA, with a threshold of P < 0.05 required to demonstrate statistical significance.\\nExposure to vedolizumab was dose proportional in pregnant rabbits (Table 1). The mean observed peak serum concentrations (Cmax) of vedolizumab were 244 µg/mL at 10 mg/kg, 818 µg/mL at 30 mg/kg, and 3,020 µg/mL at 100 mg/kg. The areas under the serum concentrations versus time curve (AUC0-337 hr) were 28,300 h·µg/mL at 10 mg/kg, 102,000 h·µg/mL at 30 mg/kg, and 36,600 h·µg/mL at 100 mg/kg.\\nOf the 100 timed-pregnant rabbits that were randomized to the 4 study groups, 92 were gravid. There were no significant differences in pregnant female mean net BW, net BW gains, and gravid uterine weights between the groups tested. There was also no statistically significant difference in mean maternal food consumption between the vedolizumab and control groups (Table 2). Of the gravid females, rates of fetal resorption and pre- or postimplantation loss were similar between the 4 study groups. Vedolizumab had no effect on the mean number of fetuses per litter (Table 2).\\nWhen fetuses were examined at GD 29, no vedolizumab-related internal findings were observed at any dose level. Fetal weights were comparable across the study groups. Overall, malformations were observed in 4 of 194, 3 of 200, 1 of 201, and 2 of 171 fetuses in the control and vedolizumab 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg dose groups, respectively; all were considered spontaneous in origin (Table 3).\\nA substantial and dose–proportional increase in vedolizumab serum levels was achieved rapidly in pregnant mothers after administration (Tmax at ∼0.9-3.4 hours; Table 4 and Supplementary Figure 1). At the 10 mg/kg dose, the mean Cmax was 333 µg/mL for GD 20 and 364 µg/mL for GD 132; mean AUC0-336 was 38,200 h·µg/mL for GD 20 and 62,200 h·µg/mL for GD 132. At the 100 mg/kg dose, the mean Cmax was 2,920 µg/mL for GD 20 and 4,140 µg/mL for GD 132; mean AUC0-336 was 440,000 h·µg/mL for GD 20 and 692,000 h·µg/mL for GD 132. Vedolizumab was detected at low levels (0.163-0.267 μg/mL) on PPD 28 in the breast milk of 3 of 11 monkeys in the 100 mg/kg group but was not detected in the breast milk of mothers who received the 10 mg/kg dose. Vedolizumab was present at low levels on PPD 28 in 4 of 7 infant monkeys in the 10 mg/kg group (concentration range, <0.125-6.9 μg/mL) and in 11 of 11 infants in the 100 mg/kg group (concentration range, 11.5-68.5 μg/mL). One infant in the 100 mg/kg group had a concentration of 0.166 μg/mL on PPD 120.\\nThere were no vedolizumab-related maternal deaths and no increase in the incidence of prenatal loss/death, stillbirth, cesarean delivery, or mean gestational length (Table 5). Two maternal deaths (euthanized in moribund condition) were reported, both of which were a consequence of bacterial infection (crypt microabscesses throughout the large intestine). This condition is a common finding in postpartum cynomolgus monkeys and was not considered related to vedolizumab treatment. Stress during gestation and a general weak condition after birth may have increased the susceptibility for infections. Both mothers delivered healthy infants. There were no vedolizumab-related changes in clinical signs including BW during pregnancy or in the postpartum period (Figure 1) and no gross evidence of vedolizumab-related maternal organ toxicity.\\nNo vedolizumab-related effects on the development of infants were observed including postnatal BW gain (Figure 2) or grip strength (Table 6), nor were there vedolizumab-related effects on neurobehavioral or morphologic parameters (Supplemental Tables 4 and 5, respectively) or vedolizumab-related changes in hematology or clinical chemistry (Supplemental Table 6). The infant of one of the moribund mothers in the 100 mg/kg group was sacrificed at the same time as the mother due to the infant’s poor condition, which included mucosal atrophy in parts of the intestine, moderate atrophy in the bone marrow of the sternum, spleen, and thymus, and atrophy of the lymphatic system, as well as insufficient nutrition. This condition was considered related to insufficient nutrition secondary to the mother’s condition and not to vedolizumab treatment.\\nIn rabbits, saturation of the α4β7 binding sites was achieved with the 30 and 100 mg/kg doses and persisted for the duration of study, supporting the sustained pharmacologic activity of vedolizumab at this dose level (Figure 3).\\nIn the pregnant monkey study, there was no marked difference in PD response in mothers for peripheral CD4+/CD45AR− T cells at either the 10 mg/kg or the 100 mg/kg dose (Figure 4A and B). The PD response in infant monkeys whose mothers were treated with vedolizumab trended similarly to the PD response in the mothers (Figure 5A and B). All infants (11/11) in the 100 mg/kg group showed target saturation on PPD 28 and 3 of these also had target saturation on PPD 120. There was no target saturation in any infant by PPD 181. In the 10 mg/kg dose group, only 3 of the 7 infants were found to have vedolizumab present in serum on PPD 28; vedolizumab levels were low (<10 µg/mL) in all cases.\\nIn rabbits, a high RAHA titer (≥18,750) on GD 20 (14 days postinfusion) developed in 2 of 3 pregnant rabbits in the 10 mg/kg group. The RAHA response in these animals appeared to be neutralizing because their exposure to vedolizumab and PD responses were reduced compared to the animals in the group with a titer of 3,750. The immunogenicity of vedolizumab at 30 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg was minimal (titers ≤3,750).\\nIn pregnant monkeys, PAHA had an effect on the TK and PD of vedolizumab in the 10 mg/kg group, resulting in lowered vedolizumab serum concentrations and reduced binding of vedolizumab to peripheral blood B cells and T cells. Positive PAHA titers (≥500) were detected in 1 of 12 mothers in the control group, 9 of 12 mothers in the 10 mg/kg group, and 9 of 12 mothers in the 100 mg/kg group. No relationship between dose and titer or dose and day of highest titer was apparent.\\nVedolizumab was mildly immunogenic in infant monkeys whose mothers were treated with vedolizumab. The PAHAs were detected in 0 of 7 infants in the control group, 2 of 7 infants in the 10 mg/kg group, and 1 of 9 infants in the 100 mg/kg group.\\nInflammatory bowel disease can affect women in their reproductive years—consequently, the safety of therapeutic agents for IBD during pregnancy is an important consideration. Pregnant patients are commonly excluded from clinical studies, and contraceptive measures are typically required for female patients at risk of pregnancy, as was the case in the vedolizumab clinical program. As a result, there is currently limited experience with vedolizumab in pregnancy from clinical studies. Although real-world evidence is being collated through postmarketing experience and registries such as PIANO and the Organization of Teratology Information Services observational pregnancy registry, supporting data from animal studies can provide valuable information regarding placental transfer and potential effects on pregnant females and their offspring.\\nRabbits and cynomolgus monkeys are among those species frequently used in preclinical assessment of monoclonal antibodies, and both are considered good models for developmental toxicity studies, although the maternal–fetal transfer of IgG antibodies with cynomolgus monkeys is closer to that of humans. In the present study, placental transfer of vedolizumab was confirmed in cynomolgus monkeys. Exposure of vedolizumab showed an increasing trend in a greater than dose proportional manner. At 100 mg/kg (the highest dose examined), saturation of binding to α4β7 sites was achieved throughout the study period. Administration of high doses of vedolizumab did not show any maternal or developmental effects in rabbits or monkeys, with vedolizumab shown to be pharmacologically active in both animal models as assessed by target binding saturation. Vedolizumab 100 mg/kg, the highest dose tested in rabbits, resulted in Cmax and AUC0-312h values of 3,020 ± 159 µg/mL and 366,000 ± 26,800 µg·h/mL, respectively, and values in monkeys of 4,140 ± 1,030 µg/mL and 692,000 ± 178,000 µg·h/mL, respectively. Based on the lack of maternal and embryo–fetal effects, 100 mg/kg (the highest dose tested) was determined to be the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) in both rabbits and monkeys; this dose is approximately 20 times the recommended human dosage.\\nAnti-human antibodies were detected in most animals to which vedolizumab was administered directly, whereas vedolizumab was only mildly immunogenic in offspring. Immunogenicity to monoclonal antibodies in nonhuman primate models is known to influence PK and PD to varying degrees. As observed with other monoclonal antibodies, the immunogenicity of vedolizumab in adult animals was greater at the lowest dose (10 mg/kg) than at higher doses of 30 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg, due to a tolerizing effect. The RAHA/PAHA responses in the lowest dosing group appeared to be neutralizing, as it affected both serum concentrations of vedolizumab and PD parameters, whereas this effect was less pronounced in higher dosing groups. A similar effect was observed with the natalizumab administration in pregnant cynomolgus monkeys, probably due to increased natalizumab clearance. Despite eliciting an immunogenic response, pharmacologically active drug exposure was observed in both mothers and infants, with continuous saturation of the α4β7 sites on peripheral lymphocytes seen at the NOAEL of 100 mg/kg/d.\\nClinical data in pregnancy are currently limited for all biologic agents used for the treatment of IBD. The majority of the pregnancy safety information from the anti-TNFα agents adalimumab and infliximab suggests low risk. Less is known about the safety of the anti-integrins in pregnancy and the exact role of α4β7 integrin in fetal development. As with other biologics, however, the current evidence suggests that in utero exposure to vedolizumab does not increase the risk of congenital abnormalities, which is supported by the animal data presented here. This correlates well with the current understanding that placental transfer of IgG begins after the crucial period of organogenesis in the first trimester. Due to similarities in placental transfer of IgG between animal models and humans, preclinical data can supplement our understanding of the effects of in utero exposure to biologic therapies. Cynomolgus monkeys may be of particular relevance in identifying safety concerns, since they are considered to be similar to humans in many aspects of reproductive physiology, including transfer via the chorioallantoic placenta. There are, however, limitations to consider when extrapolating these findings, such as the fact that these are small cohorts of non-disease-specific models. Another limitation is species differences in placental anatomy: Cynomolgus monkeys have bidiscoidal placentas, whereas humans have discoidal placentas, which could translate to differences in degree and timing of exposure between the 2 species.\\nAnimal studies similar to the present study have been conducted with other biologics for IBD, with studies in cynomolgus monkeys (adalimumab and natalizumab), guinea pigs (natalizumab), and mice (infliximab) largely supporting their safety in pregnancy. Preclinical studies with natalizumab in cynomolgus monkeys did, however, observe an increased number of spontaneous abortions in 1 study cohort as well as hematologic effects (decreased lymphocyte and platelet counts) in offspring. Nevertheless, as with vedolizumab, data in humans for all of these agents indicate no increased risk of congenital abnormalities or adverse pregnancy outcomes.\\nIn conclusion, vedolizumab did not show any potential for maternal or developmental toxicity in rabbits or monkeys. The data presented here support the growing body of clinical evidence that vedolizumab exposure represents a low risk to the mother or to the developing fetus in humans.'},\n",

       "    'fulltext': \"The introduction of tumor necrosis factor-α (anti-TNFα) antagonists transformed the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, approximately one-third of patients with IBD fail to respond (primary treatment failure). Furthermore, over a third of patients who initially responded to treatment and subsequently discontinue treatment due to loss of response or intolerance, with median time to loss of response in the real-world setting reported as between 53 and 99 weeks. Anti-TNFα treatment can also be associated with adverse events (AEs) including infection, allergic reactions and possibly malignancy, which reflects the diverse role of TNFα in immune function.\\nVedolizumab is a biological therapy that has a different mode of action to anti-TNFαs and specifically targets the gut mucosa. Vedolizumab was licensed in Europe in 2014 for the treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). While positive results were reported from the GEMINI clinical trials, evidence on early experiences of vedolizumab in the UK CD and UC population post-licensing is limited by small patient numbers and conducted in few centers, such as a study in 2 tertiary referral centers in London that included 50 patients across both diseases. Information from the UK real-world setting is required as the characteristics and management of patients treated in routine clinical practice may differ from those of patients enrolled in the GEMINI trials. Therefore, this study aimed to describe the real-world early experiences of vedolizumab in the UK to inform clinical practice and facilitate treatment decision making. It formed part of the REVIVE study—“A REtrospective UK chart review of early VedolIzumab experience: real-world effectiVEness and safety in IBD”.\\nA retrospective observational study was carried out in 5 UK secondary care centers. The study included relatively large centers with geographic representation across England and Scotland. Centers that were known to the study team to be early adopters of vedolizumab for treatment of CD and UC were selected in order to optimize both sample size and length of available follow-up.\\nPatients with a diagnosis of CD or UC and who have prescribed vedolizumab as part of routine clinical care were eligible for study participation. Patients were included in the study if they were aged\\u200a≥18 years at vedolizumab initiation, and with at least 14 or 10 weeks of follow-up history available in medical records post-initiation, respectively for CD and UC patients. Patients treated with vedolizumab as part of an interventional clinical trial and those not consenting to data collection were excluded. The study observation period was the period up to 24 months before vedolizumab initiation, and following vedolizumab initiation (patients were initiated on vedolizumab between November 2014 and April 2016) until data collection (May to July 2016).\\nAll potentially eligible patients were identified from hospital medical records. Patients provided written informed consent according to a protocol approved by the UK Health Research Authority (South Central–Oxford C) Research Ethics Committee (reference: 16/SC/0032; 15/01/2016). All procedures performed in studies involving human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the national research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amendments.\\nData were collected from hospital medical records on patient demographic and clinical characteristics (including age at vedolizumab initiation, IBD disease duration, comorbidities, prior IBD-related medication and surgery), vedolizumab treatment (including dosing, duration, reasons for discontinuation), concomitant IBD-medication, disease activity, and AEs.\\nThe main outcomes of this study included persistence and duration of treatment. Disease activity is often poorly documented in medical records and a variety of measures are utilized in clinical practice. Since data on treatment persistence is generally available for all patients, vedolizumab treatment persistence was selected as a proxy for treatment effectiveness to account for inconsistent and poor recording of disease activity in medical records, where patients showing clinical benefit and acceptable tolerability are expected to remain on treatment. Additional outcomes included clinical response and clinical remission at week 14 (CD) or 10 (UC) and safety profile.\\nDuration of treatment was taken as the time from vedolizumab initiation until data collection for patients with ongoing treatment. For patients discontinuing treatment, vedolizumab treatment duration was taken as the time from initiation until the discontinuation date recorded in the medical records or 56 days after the last vedolizumab infusion, whichever date was earliest. For the purposes of calculating vedolizumab persistence, patients remaining on treatment were censored at data collection.\\nClinical response and clinical remission were analyzed (where data were available) at week 14 in patients with CD and at week 10 in patients with UC, which is consistent with the assessment points recommended in the Entyvio Summary of Product Characteristics. Clinical response and remission were assessed in accordance with accepted standards widely used in IBD clinical trials. Clinical response was defined as a reduction of\\u200a≥3 points in the Harvey–Bradshaw Index (HBI) or an absolute HBI score\\u200a≤4 in patients with CD, and as a reduction of\\u200a≥3 points in Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index (SCCAI) or an absolute SCCAI score\\u200a≤2 in patients with UC at follow-up compared with baseline. Clinical remission was defined as an HBI score\\u200a≤4 (CD) or an SCCAI score\\u200a≤2 (UC). AEs and serious AEs (SAEs) were recorded for up to 18 weeks (5 half-lives) following vedolizumab discontinuation. This data collection included AEs of special interest (nasopharyngitis, joint pain, infusion-related reactions [IRRs], gut-specific infections, skin rash) and any AE resulting in discontinuation of vedolizumab. Further details on the assessment of clinical outcomes are provided in the supplemental methods (see text, Supplemental Digital Content 1).\\nClinical response and remission were evaluated in the intention to treat population and in the subgroup of patients with active disease at baseline (defined as HBI\\u200a≥5 in patients with CD or SCCAI\\u200a≥3 in patients with UC). Pre-defined subgroup analyses were carried out according to anti-TNFα treatment status before vedolizumab initiation (anti-TNFα naïve or anti-TNFα experienced). Categorical variables are presented as number (frequency). Quantitative variables are presented as mean (standard deviation; SD) or median (interquartile range [IQR], or range). Kaplan–Meier curves show the cumulative proportions of patients persistent on vedolizumab during follow-up, patients with ongoing treatment were censored on the date of data collection. Data were analyzed using Stata version 14 (StataCorp). No attempts were made to statistically account for missing data in analyses.\\nA total of 156 potentially eligible patients were identified and approached for consent; of these, 112 eligible patients provided written informed consent (72% of those approached) and were included in the study. As shown in Table 1, of the 112 patients included in the study, 66 patients were diagnosed with CD (mean age 42.4 [SD: 16.4] years, 27% male) and 46 patients with UC (mean age 42.5 years [SD: 18.0] years, 50% male). The mean duration of IBD at the time of treatment initiation was 13.8 years in patients with CD and 8.7 years in patients with UC. There were 16 patients who were anti-TNFα naïve at vedolizumab initiation (6 patients with CD and 10 patients with UC). The majority of patients with CD (71%, 47/66) and UC (72%, 33/46) had received 1 or more anti-TNFα therapies in the 2 years prior to vedolizumab initiation. At least 1 bowel, perianal or other surgical procedure considered to be related to IBD or associated complications in the 12 months prior to vedolizumab initiation was recorded for 12% (8/66) of patients with CD and 7% (3/46) of patients with UC.\\nIn patients with CD (n\\u200a=\\u200a66), the median duration of follow-up was 7.4 (IQR: 5.7–9.4) months and the median duration of vedolizumab treatment was 6.3 (IQR: 5.2–8.1) months. In patients with UC (n\\u200a=\\u200a46), the median duration of follow-up was 7.4 (IQR: 5.6–10.2) months and the median duration of treatment was 7.1 (IQR: 5.4–9.3) months.\\nAt data collection, 80% (53/66) of patients with CD and 89% (41/46) of patients with UC were persistent on vedolizumab. Persistence with vedolizumab is shown in Figure 1 as estimated cumulative proportions of patients who remained on treatment during follow-up. Based on the Kaplan–Meier curves, the proportions of patients with CD who were persistent on vedolizumab at week 14, 6 months, and 12 months were 95%, 83%, and 73%, respectively. In patients with UC, the proportions of patients persistent on vedolizumab at week 10, 6 months, and 12 months were 98%, 93%, and 85%, respectively. Median vedolizumab persistence had not been reached in patients with CD or UC at data collection.\\nSixteen patients were anti-TNFα naïve at initiation, consisting of 6 patients with CD and 10 patients with UC. All of the 6 patients with CD and 9 of the patients with UC were persistent on vedolizumab at data collection (median follow-up 8.1 [IQR: 5.1–9.7] months and 6.4 [IQR: 5.4–9.0] months, respectively). In anti-TNFα experienced patients, 78% (47/60) of patients with CD and 89% (32/36) patients with UC were persistent on vedolizumab at data collection (median follow-up 7.4 [IQR: 5.7–9.4] months and 7.6 [IQR: 5.8–10.8] months, respectively).\\nThirteen patients with CD (20%, 13/66) discontinued treatment, including 5 patients who discontinued before the week 14 infusion. The most commonly recorded reasons for discontinuation among patients with CD (not mutually exclusive) were lack of efficacy (54%, 7/13), loss of efficacy (8%, 1/13) and AEs (15%, 2/13). Five patients with UC discontinued vedolizumab (11%, 5/46), including 2 patients who discontinued before the week 14 infusion. The most commonly recorded reasons for discontinuation among patients with UC (not mutually exclusive) were lack of efficacy (80%, 4/5), loss of efficacy (20%, 1/5) and AEs (20%, 1/5).\\nA variety of measures were used to assess baseline disease activity, with HBI being the most commonly recorded in patients with CD (31/66 [47%]) and SCCAI being the most commonly recorded in patients with UC (18/46 [39%]). In patients with CD and recorded HBI disease activity assessments at baseline and follow-up, 79% (15/19) had a clinical response at week 14 and 68% (13/19) were in clinical remission. In patients with UC and recorded SCCAI assessments at baseline and follow-up, 92% (11/12) of patients had a clinical response at week 10 and 67% (8/12) were in clinical remission. In the subgroup of patients with active disease at baseline and with disease activity assessments at follow-up, 83% (10/12) of patients with CD had a clinical response at week 14 and 67% (8/12) were in clinical remission. In patients with UC, 88% (7/8) had a clinical response at week 10 and 50% (4/8) were in clinical remission.\\nAEs were reported in 35% (23/66) of patients with CD and 26% (12/46) of patients with UC. Two SAEs were reported in patients with CD (Table 2): 1 SAE was an anaphylactoid reaction on concomitant mercaptopurine which occurred on the second infusion. The infusion was stopped and the patient discontinued vedolizumab. The second SAE was vomiting. One SAE was reported in a patient with CD, which was vomiting and diarrhea. AEs of special interest were reported in 15 patients with CD and 8 patients with UC. These included 1 case of nasopharyngitis in a patient with CD. IRRs were reported in only 1 patient with CD and 1 patient with UC.\\nThe results from this multi-center study on early experiences in real-world clinical practice in the UK suggest that vedolizumab is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for CD and UC in adults. Our results are broadly consistent with the GEMINI trials and previous observational studies. The demographic and clinical characteristics of the study sample were comparable with previous non-interventional studies that investigated vedolizumab treatment outcomes.\\nAfter a median follow-up of 7.4 months post-initiation, at least 80% of patients persisted on vedolizumab treatment. Although a relatively short follow up period is reported in this study, the results are encouraging for persistence during the early maintenance phase for both CD and UC patients, including patients who were anti-TNFα naïve at initiation.\\nAs anticipated, recording of disease activity in medical records at the time points of interest (baseline, as well as week 14 in patients with CD and week 10 in patients with UC) was limited. This finding reflects those from the 2016 UK IBD Audit which found that only 31% of adult patients with IBD had disease activity recorded in their medical records within 3 months of starting a new biologic, suggesting a variety of real-world patient-level and service-level factors contribute to low levels of recording of disease severity. As limited disease activity data were available, and only for a proportion of patients in this study, interpretation of the results on clinical response and remission must be made with caution. The supplemental table (see table, Supplemental Digital Content 2) summarizes the responses observed in our study with the current published real-life experience of vedolizumab. Until assessment and recording of disease activity as part of routine care are improved, retrospective studies like ours that rely on medical records will not be able to comprehensively determine the impact of vedolizumab treatment on clinical response or remission on the IBD population in the real-world. While this type of real-world evidence have less internal validity compared with a formal registration study demonstrating efficacy, many patients are excluded from these studies and real-world data is crucial to demonstrate clinical effectiveness in the whole cohort of patients exposed to a treatment.\\nIn this study, 20% of patients with CD and 11% of patients with UC discontinued vedolizumab, with lack of efficacy as the most commonly recorded reason. Less than half of patients who discontinued treatment did so before the week 14 infusion. No new safety signals were identified in this study and few SAEs were observed, which reflect published evidence from clinical trial and real-world settings. Similarly, IRRs were reported in only 2% of patients with CD and UC, respectively, which corresponds to findings from other observational studies.\\nAlthough the sample size was relatively small, this study presents results of early vedolizumab use in the UK from a geographically representative group of hospitals. Results are provided for patients initiated on vedolizumab shortly after the drug became available in the UK before which alternative treatment options for many of these patients were not available. In the future, patients are likely to be initiated on vedolizumab sooner in the course of their disease and therefore results presented in this early cohort may differ from findings in future UK clinical practice. Studies to provide evidence on longer-term effectiveness are underway and will add to the body of real-world evidence on appropriate uses of vedolizumab in the real-world setting.\\nRetrospective data collection from patient medical records was used in this study and therefore analyses were affected by the quality and completeness of original data entry. For example, data were missing for some patient characteristics such as disease location. As described earlier, there were limited data recorded on disease activity assessments, which restricted analyses of clinical response and remission. While few AEs were reported in this study, it is acknowledged that recording of AE data in medical records may be incomplete. However, it is expected that SAEs and IRRs would be captured and the number of these events identified in this study were low.\\nThis study demonstrated effective treatment of IBD with vedolizumab in real-world practice in the UK, as indicated by high rates of persistence with treatment and promising response and remission rates for patients with recorded disease activity data. No new safety signals were identified. These findings support the ongoing use of vedolizumab to treat CD and UC.\\nThe authors would like to acknowledge the support of pH Associates, a healthcare consultancy company (funded by Takeda UK Ltd) who were involved in study design, implementation, data collection, data analysis, interpretation of results and medical writing assistance in the drafting and revision of this manuscript (provided by Angela M Carter and Carmen Tsang).\\nFG performed the statistical analyses.

       "    'fulltext': \"Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) are chronic idiopathic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) for which no medical cure presently exists. Patients with moderate‐to‐severe IBD typically require treatment with immunosuppressive medications, and biologic agents are gaining favour due to their efficacy and safety profiles.1, 2 Hypothesised mechanisms of lack or loss of response to monoclonal antibodies include increased serum clearance and development of immunogenicity, both of which may lead to a decrease in serum concentrations and decrease in clinical response rates.3 Numerous studies of anti‐tumour necrosis factor alpha (anti‐TNFα) therapy have documented an association between low serum drug concentrations and low rates of favourable outcomes, such as clinical response, clinical remission and endoscopic mucosal healing.4, 5, 6, 7 As such, exposure‐response evaluations with measurement of drug concentrations and anti‐drug antibody concentrations have been increasingly utilised in an effort to optimise the use of these agents.3, 8, 9, 10 \\nVedolizumab is a humanised monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the α4β7 integrin and blocks lymphocyte interaction with mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule‐1 expressed on the endothelium of mesenteric lymph nodes and gastrointestinal mucosa.11 As a result, vedolizumab impairs the migration of gut‐homing lymphocytes into gastrointestinal mucosa and acts via a gut‐selective mechanism of action.11 The efficacy of vedolizumab for the treatment of active UC was demonstrated in the large, randomised, controlled trial GEMINI 1.12 Among patients in GEMINI 1 treated with vedolizumab, 300\\xa0mg every 8\\xa0weeks (the US Food and Drug Administration [FDA]‐approved labelled dosing), a trend towards increasing clinical response at week 52 with increasing vedolizumab concentration quartiles at week 46 was observed.12 In addition, a post‐hoc analysis of GEMINI 1 reported that rates of endoscopic mucosal healing at weeks 6 and 52 improved with increasing vedolizumab concentration quartiles at weeks 6 and 46 respectively.13 A post‐hoc analysis of data from the wider GEMINI clinical trial programme including patients with either UC or CD found that higher vedolizumab concentrations were associated with higher clinical remission rates.14 Although several small real‐world observational studies have evaluated vedolizumab concentrations and clinical outcomes,15, 16, 17, 18 the studies did not control for the influence of confounding factors on potential associations. Therefore, there is a need for further exploration in an established vedolizumab treatment population such as the participants in the vedolizumab GEMINI trials.\\nTo date, exposure‐response studies of biologics in IBD have had two important limitations: (a) they were not designed prospectively with the primary aim of making inferences about the drug exposure‐response relationship; and (b) data were analysed on a population level rather than an individual level, without adjustment for variables that could potentially affect drug clearance and resulting drug concentrations, most notably disease activity/inflammatory burden, serum albumin concentration and body weight.3, 19 Therefore, studies demonstrating differences in drug concentrations between responders and nonresponders reveal considerable heterogeneity, not only in drug concentration cut‐off values predictive of response, but also in drug concentration ranges between responders and nonresponders.4, 7, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24 \\nThus, given the limited information on the exposure‐response relationship with vedolizumab and the paucity of adjusted exposure‐response data for biologic agents used to treat IBD, the analyses herein aimed to characterise the relationship between vedolizumab exposure and response in UC using patient‐level data from GEMINI 1 adjusted for variables known to affect drug clearance and serum concentration. Although methodologies such as quartile analyses and receiver operating characteristic analyses have historically been employed to evaluate the relationship between biologic drug exposure and response, these approaches have the major limitation of not accounting for confounding factors and correlations between endpoints. Consequently, propensity‐score‐based case‐matching was used in the current analysis because one of its unique strengths is the ability to account for confounding factors. Potential vedolizumab concentration targets at important time points during treatment (weeks 6, 14 and steady state) were also proposed. Of note, the data from the week 6 proposed concentration target were generated in part to help design the currently ongoing vedolizumab dose‐optimisation randomised controlled trial, ENTERPRET (NCT03029143). An additional aim was to identify whether early vedolizumab concentrations (at weeks 2, 4 and 6) were associated with improved short‐term (at week 14) and long‐term (at week 52) clinical outcomes in GEMINI 1.\\nIn the induction phase of GEMINI 1, patients received either double‐blind or open‐label vedolizumab 300\\xa0mg at weeks 0 and 2. Patients with a clinical response at week 6 were re‐randomised 1:1:1 to receive vedolizumab 300\\xa0mg every 8\\xa0weeks, vedolizumab 300\\xa0mg every 4\\xa0weeks or placebo, and followed to week 52 (Figure S1).13 Patients without a response at week 6 received vedolizumab 300\\xa0mg every 4\\xa0weeks throughout the maintenance phase. Patients treated with placebo during induction continued to receive placebo during maintenance. Ethical guidelines have been previously published for GEMINI 1 (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00783718).12 \\nIn GEMINI 1, clinical assessments were performed using the complete Mayo Score at weeks 0, 6 and 52 and the 9‐point partial Mayo Score (eg, complete Mayo Score without the endoscopy sub‐score) at all other time points. To examine the vedolizumab exposure‐response relationship in the present analysis, two outcomes were used: (a) clinical response, defined as a reduction in complete or partial Mayo Score of ≥3 points and ≥30% from baseline, as well as a decrease of ≥1 point on the rectal bleeding sub‐score or an absolute rectal bleeding sub‐score ≤1 and (b) clinical remission, defined as a complete or partial Mayo Score of ≤2 points with no individual sub‐score >1. To examine the association between early vedolizumab concentrations at weeks 2, 4 and 6 and clinical outcomes at weeks 14 and 52, clinical remission was selected as the sole outcome measure, given that it is a more rigorous endpoint, and was defined for both time points as a partial Mayo Score of ≤2 points with no individual sub‐score >1.\\nIn GEMINI 1, vedolizumab concentrations in serum samples were measured using a direct capture, pharmacokinetic, enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; sandwich), with a lower limit of detection of 0.125\\xa0µg/mL. The time points at which these concentrations were drawn were just prior to vedolizumab infusions at weeks 2 and 6 and at the week 4 study visit.\\nA number of variables that can potentially affect the clearance of vedolizumab have been identified in a prior population pharmacokinetic analysis and included patient age, weight, history of anti‐TNFα treatment, serum albumin concentration and faecal calprotectin concentration.19 In that analysis, which included approximately 20\\xa0000 serum samples from 2000 patients, vedolizumab clearance and serum concentrations were estimated based on multiple vedolizumab studies, including a phase 1 healthy volunteer study, a phase 2 study in UC and the large phase 3 GEMINI 1 and 2 randomised controlled trials (GEMINI 2 showed that vedolizumab was effective as induction and maintenance therapy for active CD).12, 19, 25, 26 These data led to the development of a full covariate model capable of characterising vedolizumab pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics more completely.19 In the current analysis, the relationship between patient‐specific covariates and estimated vedolizumab clearance and vedolizumab concentrations were expressed as P values for the monotonic trend analysis. P values for trends were also explored using the exact Cochran‐Armitage trend test.\\nThe GEMINI 1 trial lacked a prospectively randomised dose‐ranging design, thus creating the potential for an imbalance in observed and unobserved patient‐specific covariates that could confound causal inference in the vedolizumab exposure‐response relationship. Candidate confounding covariates in the observed data were identified based on the prior multi‐study population pharmacokinetic analysis mentioned above.19 Imbalance in the observed covariates across exposure quartiles was evaluated graphically and with quartile‐specific data summaries.\\nTo characterise the vedolizumab exposure‐response relationship, a propensity‐score‐based case‐matching analysis was performed, adjusting for potential imbalance in observed covariates (patient age, weight, history of anti‐TNFα treatment, serum albumin concentration and faecal calprotectin concentration) across the exposure range. For each vedolizumab exposure quartile at both week 6 and steady state, a logistic propensity‐score model was fitted to data from the vedolizumab‐treated patients and all control subjects (ie, those receiving placebo), using all measured covariates as predictors. The propensity score was used to match treated patients with controls to establish a reference point for response at zero drug exposure (eg, absence of vedolizumab). A robust estimate of the standard deviation (SD) of the propensity‐score distribution was then obtained based on the median absolute deviation of the fitted propensity scores. For each patient in the exposure quartile, a match was randomly selected with replacement from the subjects in the control arm with propensity scores within a calliper of 0.2 times the robust estimate of the SD obtained in the previous step. Treated patients without a matched control were excluded from the outcome analysis. The matching step was repeated 1000 times for each candidate match, and the absolute standardised difference in means (ASDM) was calculated for all covariate main effects and two‐way interactions. The optimal subset of matched controls was identified as the candidate match with the lowest maximum ASDM among interaction effects that satisfied an ASDM <0.2 for all main effects. This method resulted in an exposure‐response data subset that was balanced across observed covariates. The extent of remaining imbalance across unobserved factors was not possible to assess.\\nThe exposure‐response analysis was conducted using the full data set and the case‐matched subset. Specifically, the rates of clinical response and remission and the distribution of the odds ratios of clinical response and remission were calculated for each quartile of estimated vedolizumab clearance at week 6 and estimated vedolizumab concentrations at week 6 and steady state (trough, during maintenance). Trends in the distribution of the odds ratios of clinical response and remission with increasing estimated vedolizumab clearance or estimated concentration quartiles were examined to determine the robustness of the exposure‐response relationship.\\nFor this analysis, a clinically meaningful target response was defined as a reduction in partial Mayo Score of at least 3 units. The quartiles of clearance and exposure associated with this response magnitude were identified. Given the quartile‐based boundary on clearance, the FDA label‐specified dosing regimen with vedolizumab maintenance at 300\\xa0mg every 8\\xa0weeks, and the prior population pharmacokinetic model, potential target vedolizumab concentrations associated with a clinically meaningful response were proposed at therapeutically important time points: week 6 (during induction), week 14 (end of induction period) and steady state (representing trough, during maintenance after day 128 [ie, after five 25.5‐day linear elimination half‐lives of vedolizumab]).\\nTo determine whether early vedolizumab concentrations at weeks 2, 4 and 6 were associated with clinical remission at week 14, the analysis cohort was restricted to GEMINI 1 patients in the intention‐to‐treat population who were randomised to receive maintenance vedolizumab 300\\xa0mg every 8\\xa0weeks, as this is the FDA‐approved dose and reflects current clinical practice. Two separate analyses were conducted. First, vedolizumab concentrations at weeks 2, 4 and 6 were stratified by clinical remission status at week 14. Second, clinical remission status at week 14 was stratified by vedolizumab concentration quartiles at weeks 2, 4 and 6. Patients were not case‐matched to maximise the number of samples for analysis. The nonparametric Wilcoxon rank‐sum test was used to compare vedolizumab concentrations at weeks 2, 4 and 6 stratified by remitters vs nonremitters at week 14. Trends in clinical remission status at week 14 or week 52 stratified by vedolizumab serum concentration quartiles at weeks 2, 4 and 6 were explored using the exact Cochran‐Armitage trend test.\\nCompared with week 6, vedolizumab concentrations at weeks 2 and 4 did not have as consistent an association with rates of clinical remission at week 14 (see Section 2.1). The association between clinical remission at week 52 and early vedolizumab concentrations was therefore restricted to week 6 concentrations and was calculated by vedolizumab concentration quartile. To increase the sample size for this analysis, the entire GEMINI 1 cohort12 was used, including subjects who received placebo and open‐label induction vedolizumab, and patients were not case‐matched.\\nOf note, clinical outcomes with respect to the presence of anti‐vedolizumab antibodies were not assessed in this analysis, as only 3.7% of GEMINI 1 patients were antibody positive at any time and only 1.0% were persistently positive (ie, at ≥2 consecutive visits).12 Thus, the sample size of the antibody‐positive population was too small to perform any meaningful analysis.\\nOf the 746 patients who received at least one dose of vedolizumab in GEMINI 1, 693 (93%) had vedolizumab concentrations assessed at week 6 and were included in the exposure‐response analysis. Characteristics of these patients are shown in Table 1. Of note, patients had a mean disease duration of 6.9\\xa0years, mean complete Mayo Score of 8.5 and a mean partial Mayo Score of 6.0; 347 (50%) had disease proximal to the splenic flexure, and 281 (41%) had received prior anti‐TNFα therapy.\\nTrends were observed between patient‐specific covariates and estimated clearance and concentrations of vedolizumab (Figure 1). Specifically, history of prior anti‐TNFα treatment (P\\xa0<\\xa00.0001), lower serum albumin concentration (P\\xa0<\\xa00.0001) and higher faecal calprotectin concentration (P\\xa0<\\xa00.0001) were each associated with higher estimated vedolizumab clearance quartiles at week 6 and lower estimated vedolizumab concentration quartiles at both week 6 and steady state. Similar but less consistent associations were also observed for patient age (P\\xa0≤\\xa00.0210) and weight (P\\xa0≤\\xa00.0013). These findings indicated a strong imbalance in the distribution of measured covariates across exposure or clearance quartiles, but it is unknown if similar imbalance existed across other unmeasured factors. For each vedolizumab concentration quartile at week 6 and steady state prior to covariate‐based case‐matching, the majority of the ASDMs for the patient‐specific covariate main effects were >0.1. However, these ASDMs were <0.1 after case‐matching, indicating good matching between patients receiving vedolizumab and those receiving placebo.\\nGiven the case‐matching‐adjusted data, rates of clinical response and remission decreased with increasing estimated vedolizumab clearance quartiles at week 6, whereas these rates rose with increasing estimated vedolizumab concentration quartiles at both week 6 and steady state (P\\xa0<\\xa00.0001; Figure 2). Specifically, clinical response rates ranged from 27%‐32% in the highest clearance/lowest vedolizumab concentration quartiles to 62%‐66% in the lowest clearance/highest vedolizumab concentration quartiles. Clinical remission rates ranged from 6%‐8% in the highest clearance/lowest vedolizumab concentration quartiles to 33%‐36% in the lowest clearance/highest vedolizumab concentration quartiles. When examining the distribution of the odds ratios of clinical response and remission by estimated vedolizumab clearance quartiles at week 6 and by estimated vedolizumab concentration quartiles at week 6 and steady state, consistent trends towards increasing odds ratios with decreasing clearance/increasing vedolizumab concentration quartiles were observed. These trends were most apparent for clinical response with week 6 vedolizumab clearance and steady‐state vedolizumab concentrations, and for clinical remission with week 6 vedolizumab concentrations (Figure 3).\\nBecause an estimated vedolizumab clearance of <0.14\\xa0L/d was associated with high rates of clinical response, potential target vedolizumab concentrations at the clinically important time points of week 6 (during induction), week 14 (end of induction period) and steady state (representing trough, during maintenance) were proposed based on this value. Using the vedolizumab pharmacokinetic model and the standard FDA‐approved every‐8‐weeks maintenance dosing schedule of vedolizumab, the following concentrations were calculated for a clearance of ≤0.14\\xa0L/d: >37.1\\xa0μg/mL at week 6, >18.4\\xa0μg/mL at week 14 and >12.7\\xa0μg/mL at steady‐state trough.\\nTo determine the earliest time point at which measurement of vedolizumab concentrations was associated with clinical remission at week 14, vedolizumab concentration data at weeks 2, 4 and 6 were assessed in patients randomised to vedolizumab 300\\xa0mg every 8\\xa0weeks in the maintenance arm of GEMINI 1. Patients in this arm were similar to those receiving vedolizumab 300\\xa0mg every 4\\xa0weeks or to those receiving placebo in terms of baseline characteristics (including disease activity and prior immunomodulator use), except for a numerically longer disease duration for patients receiving vedolizumab every 4\\xa0weeks (disease duration of 7.6\\xa0years) compared with vedolizumab every 8\\xa0weeks (disease duration of 6.2\\xa0years) (Table S1). Patients who achieved clinical remission at week 14 showed higher week 4 (P\\xa0=\\xa00.0328) and week 6 (P\\xa0=\\xa00.0418) vedolizumab concentrations compared with those who did not achieve remission at week 14; at week 2, vedolizumab concentrations were generally similar between patients who later achieved remission at week 14 and those who did not (P\\xa0=\\xa00.4592; Figure 4). When examining clinical remission status at week 14 by vedolizumab concentration quartiles at weeks 2, 4 and 6, a consistent trend for increasing remission with increasing vedolizumab concentration was observed at week 4 (P\\xa0=\\xa00.0469) and week 6 (P\\xa0=\\xa00.0098), but not at week 2 (P\\xa0=\\xa00.6766; Figure 5). At week 6, a 40% remission rate was reported in the lowest concentration quartile vs 74% in the highest quartile.\\nGiven that it was only at week 6 that vedolizumab concentrations exhibited a consistent association with rates of clinical remission at week 14, the association between clinical remission at week 52 and early vedolizumab concentrations was restricted to week 6, but was expanded to include the entire GEMINI 1 cohort. Clinical remission rates at week 52 increased consistently with increasing quartiles of vedolizumab concentration at week 6, with a 15% remission rate in the lowest concentration quartile and 37% in the highest quartile (Figure 6).\\nExposure‐response metrics have increasingly been used to optimise IBD treatment with anti‐TNFα agents, but the vast majority of the reported analyses were based on studies not prospectively designed from exposure‐response inferences or adjusted for potential confounding factors.3, 8, 9, 10 In fact, only recently was the first study with patient‐level covariate adjustment of the exposure‐response relationship for anti‐TNFα therapy published, by Vande Casteele et al,27 in patients with CD treated with certolizumab pegol. Very limited data on the vedolizumab exposure‐response relationship are currently available to guide clinicians. Our analysis of the large GEMINI 1 randomised controlled trial data set identified a clear exposure‐response relationship for vedolizumab in UC, even after adjusting for potential confounding factors. Potential target vedolizumab concentrations during therapy were proposed using pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data from multiple trials as follows: >37.1, >18.4 and >12.7\\xa0μg/mL at week 6, week 14 and steady state (ie, after day 128) respectively. Additionally, when examining early measurements of vedolizumab, unadjusted concentrations at week 6 were consistently associated with short‐ and long‐term clinical remission (at weeks 14 and 52 respectively), implying that the early use of exposure‐response data during treatment may provide an opportunity for dose optimisation sooner than week 10, as was previously described.28 \\nThe association between observed vedolizumab concentrations and clinical efficacy is not surprising because similar trends have been observed with anti‐TNFα treatment of patients with IBD, and a wealth of data demonstrates that higher infliximab and adalimumab concentrations during maintenance are associated with improved clinical outcomes.3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 21, 22, 23, 24 Furthermore, recent data have shown that higher induction and/or immediate post‐induction serum concentrations of infliximab and adalimumab, starting as early as week 2, are associated with improved outcomes in IBD.7, 29, 30 The interpretation of these results, however, is limited by the lack of prospective exposure‐response designs, and it is not known if a true causal relationship between exposure and response exists at the doses studied.\\nThe results of the current analysis are consistent with those of several recent observational studies that examined a potential relationship between vedolizumab concentration and treatment response. Additional published data regarding vedolizumab concentrations and clinical outcomes include a recent retrospective analysis of a real‐world population of 179 patients with IBD (UC, 66; CD, 113), which demonstrated a significant correlation between vedolizumab exposure and treatment response. Vedolizumab trough concentrations >30\\xa0μg/mL at week 2, >24\\xa0μg/mL at week 6 and >14\\xa0μg/mL during maintenance therapy were associated with a higher probability of achieving improved efficacy (endoscopic healing, clinical response, biologic response or remission; P\\xa0<\\xa00.05).15 A prospective, real‐world study demonstrated that patients with IBD who achieved clinical remission had higher vedolizumab concentrations compared to those with active disease.17 Similarly, a prospective, single‐centre, observational study reported a significant correlation between higher vedolizumab trough levels and improved clinical response in patients with IBD.16 Finally, a prospective, multicentre, observational study demonstrated that early vedolizumab trough levels predict mucosal healing in patients with IBD.18 Collectively, these results support the monitoring of vedolizumab trough concentrations in patients with IBD as a means of predicting clinical outcomes and suggest that early monitoring may be helpful in identifying patients who may derive benefit from an intensified dosing regimen. However, these were small observational studies that showed consistent results despite the lack of adjustment for confounding factors. To our knowledge, the current study represents the largest vedolizumab patient data set available for this type of analysis, and the analyses were adjusted for variables that could potentially affect drug clearance and resulting drug concentrations.\\nThe current analysis was undertaken to extend these observations and evaluate the vedolizumab exposure‐response profile, with adjustment for variables known to affect vedolizumab clearance. Previously reported exposure‐response data on anti‐TNFα therapy have been almost exclusively population‐based rather than at an individual patient level, without adjustment for factors, such as disease activity and serum albumin, which can potentially confound the drug exposure‐response relationship. In contrast, the present analysis was adjusted for the five variables that have been previously identified as being independently influential on vedolizumab drug clearance (patient age, weight, history of anti‐TNFα therapy, serum albumin concentration and faecal calprotectin concentration).19 The propensity‐score‐based case‐matching algorithm used in this analysis created well‐matched data that allowed analysis of the drug exposure‐response relationship without confounding due to these variables.\\nInterestingly, the potential vedolizumab concentration target of >37.1\\xa0μg/mL at week 6 that we proposed in this analysis to optimise clinical response is very similar to that observed in a recent post‐hoc analysis of endoscopic mucosal healing in GEMINI 1.13 In that study, in which rates of mucosal healing improved with increasing vedolizumab concentration quartiles, the highest vedolizumab concentration quartile at week 6 corresponded to a concentration of >35.7\\xa0μg/mL. In contrast, a study by Williet et al reported that vedolizumab trough concentrations of <18.5\\xa0µg/mL at week 6 were associated with a need for drug optimisation within 6\\xa0months, with an AUROC of 72%.31 However, that study differed from the present analysis in a number of ways: the Williet et al study was rather small, with only 47 patients in total; two‐thirds of the patients in that study had CD, which may be important because the observed vedolizumab dose‐response relationship was less consistent in GEMINI 2 (CD)25 compared with GEMINI 1 (UC)12; and that study did not adjust for factors known to affect vedolizumab clearance. Nevertheless, the median serum vedolizumab concentration in primary responders was 42.5\\xa0µg/mL at week 6 in the Williet et al study, which is similar to the week 6 value of >37.1\\xa0μg/mL derived in our analysis. Furthermore, based on the results of our analysis, week 6 appears to be the earliest time point to consider therapeutic drug monitoring with vedolizumab, given the consistent association and statistical trends between vedolizumab concentration quartiles and clinical outcomes.\\nThe strength of the present analysis is that the largest data sets of vedolizumab pharmacokinetic data (derived from the multi‐study population pharmacokinetic analysis19) and clinical response data (from GEMINI 112) were combined to propose potential target vedolizumab concentrations during treatment and to identify the earliest time point at which exposure‐response analysis might be beneficial in clinical practice. Additionally, data were taken from randomised controlled trials, which represent the least biased method of data collection currently available.\\nAlthough the present analysis is limited by its post‐hoc design, it likely provides the most robust insight into vedolizumab exposure‐response to date. An ongoing, phase 4, open‐label, randomised controlled trial (ENTERPRET; NCT03029143) is the first clinical study to prospectively evaluate vedolizumab exposure‐response; this study is comparing the efficacy and safety of intravenous vedolizumab dose optimisation vs standard vedolizumab intravenous dosing in patients with moderately to severely active UC who are nonresponders and have high vedolizumab clearance. ENTERPRET, which was designed using the results of the present analysis as a guide for dose adjustment in the dose‐optimisation arm, began enrolling patients in April 2017.\\nIn conclusion, this analysis of the vedolizumab exposure‐response relationship used patient‐level data from a large data set and adjusted for factors known to affect vedolizumab clearance. Potential target vedolizumab concentrations at weeks 6, 14 and steady state during treatment were proposed to be >37.1, >18.4 and >12.7\\xa0µg/mL respectively. Additionally, week 6 was identified as the earliest time point at which vedolizumab concentrations were consistently associated with short‐ and long‐term remission. Until the ongoing ENTERPRET randomised controlled trial is completed, the results of the present analysis provide the most comprehensively adjusted description of the exposure‐response relationship for vedolizumab in UC to date.\\n Guarantor of the article: Dr Osterman serves as the guarantor of the article.\\n Author contributions: In the preparation of this article, all authors made substantial contributions to the conception or design of the work; or the acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data.

       "    'fulltext': 'Deep remission is emerging as an important treatment goal for patients with ulcerative colitis [UC] to improve outcomes beyond clinical remission and towards modifying the disease course.\\nThe currently accepted definition of clinical remission includes normalization of patient-reported symptoms [rectal bleeding and stool frequency] and endoscopic healing. Regulatory agencies support such a composite of symptomatic and endoscopic improvement as a clinical trial outcome in the evaluation of treatment for UC. The US Food and Drug Administration [FDA] guidance on clinical remission as an endpoint in clinical trials recommends a definition based on the Mayo Clinic Score consisting of a rectal bleeding score [RBS] of 0, a stool frequency score [SFS] of 0 and an endoscopic score [ES] of 0 or 1, with a score of 0 on the UC Disease Activity Index [UCDAI] as an alternative. The European Medicines Agency [EMA] guidance on the definition of remission in UC also cites the Mayo Clinic Score with a preferred definition of remission as an ES of 0, although a score of 0 or 1 on the ES, RBS or SFS is also an acceptable definition. However, currently there is no standardized definition for assessing deep remission in UC. In principle, deep remission is intended to represent complete disease quiescence with ES, RBS and SFS of 0 [although it is debatable whether increased stool frequency is completely reversible, probably due to structural damage in some patients] and should be the clinical target that physicians strive to achieve for their patients. More analyses are needed to assess the utility of deep remission as a clinical outcome in patients with UC.\\nMoreover, studies of anti-tumour necrosis factor alpha [TNFα] agents have also suggested a positive correlation between high trough serum drug concentrations and favourable therapeutic outcomes, which include endoscopic healing. A study by Paul et al. showed that mean trough serum concentrations of infliximab were higher in patients with UC in clinical remission [1.9 µg/mL] compared with patients with active disease [0.9 µg/mL; p = 0.01]. The impact of therapeutic drug monitoring on clinical remission was also demonstrated in a distinct cohort of patients who required dose intensification. An increase in infliximab trough levels was strongly associated with clinical remission after infliximab dose optimization [p = 0.0001]. A recent analysis confirmed that infliximab trough concentrations during maintenance therapy were associated with endoscopic and histological healing in patients with UC. The association between drug trough serum concentrations and improved clinical and endoscopic outcomes suggests that incorporation of therapeutic drug monitoring into clinical practice may allow clinicians to optimize treatment by maintaining effective drug concentrations over time. However, the usefulness of proactive drug monitoring has not been established.\\nVedolizumab [ENTYVIO; Takeda Pharmaceuticals] is a gut-selective humanized monoclonal antibody that targets α4β7 integrin. The efficacy of vedolizumab in achieving clinical remission and endoscopic healing in patients with UC has been established, with 52-week rates of clinical remission of 41.8% and 44.8% for those receiving vedolizumab 300 mg every 8 weeks [Q8W] and every 4 weeks [Q4W], respectively, and mucosal healing rates of 51.6% and 56.0%, respectively. Vedolizumab has been recommended by recent guidelines from the European Crohn’s and Colitis Organisation [ECCO] as a treatment option for patients with UC and is included in the American Gastroenterological Association [AGA] Care Pathway as induction and maintenance therapy for patients with UC at high risk of colectomy.\\nIn previous studies, higher rates of endoscopic healing were associated with higher vedolizumab trough serum concentrations in patients with UC. Understanding the relationship between trough serum drug concentrations and deep remission may help to inform clinicians about optimal treatment strategies, thereby increasing the likelihood of achieving this favourable outcome in patients with UC.\\nHere, we describe a post hoc analysis of the phase 3 GEMINI 1 trial to determine the efficacy of vedolizumab in inducing deep remission at Week 52 in patients with UC. The correlation between vedolizumab trough serum concentrations and rates of deep remission was also explored.\\nThe GEMINI 1 study [NCT00783718] evaluated the efficacy and safety of vedolizumab 300 mg in the treatment of patients with UC as induction and maintenance therapy for up to 52 weeks. The design and outcomes of this trial have been described previously; the protocol was approved by an investigational review board at each study centre, and all patients provided their written informed consent. For the current study, all authors had access to the study data and approved the final manuscript.\\nBriefly, patients with moderately to severely active UC received vedolizumab induction therapy consisting of either double-blind or open-label vedolizumab 300 mg at Weeks 0 and 2. Patients with a clinical response at Week 6 were then re-randomized to placebo or maintenance vedolizumab 300 mg Q8W or Q4W with no dose escalation, and patients who did not achieve a clinical response by Week 6 received open-label vedolizumab 300 mg Q4W. All patients were followed to Week 52. The induction intention-to-treat [ITT] population consisted of all randomized patients who received any amount of blinded study drug during Weeks 0–6. The maintenance ITT population consisted of all randomized patients who received vedolizumab during the induction phase, met the protocol definition of clinical response at Week 6, were randomized and received any amount of double-blind study drug in the maintenance phase.\\nThis analysis included all vedolizumab-treated patients who were responders at Week 6 [induction ITT population; Supplementary Figure S1, cohort 1] or to open-label induction therapy [Supplementary Figure S1, cohort 2].\\nFour definitions of deep remission in the maintenance ITT population were delineated based on the stringency of remission criteria. The four definitions are listed in order from most stringent to least stringent in Table 1. End points were defined using various combinations of endoscopic outcomes [Mayo Clinic ES] and patient-reported outcomes [Mayo Clinic RBS and SFS]. Endoscopic appearance was evaluated at Weeks 0, 6 and 52, and categorized according to Mayo Clinic criteria as: 0 for normal/inactive disease; 1 for mild disease [erythema, decreased vascular pattern, mild friability]; 2 for moderate disease [marked erythema, lack of vascular pattern, friability, erosions]; and 3 for severe disease [spontaneous bleeding, ulceration]. Histological analyses and central evaluation of endoscopies were not included in the GEMINI 1 study protocol; therefore, these data were not available for consideration in the present analyses. Symptomatic data [rectal bleeding and stool frequency] were collected daily via an automated telephone diary system. At Week 52, RBS and SFS were calculated using diaries from the previous 7 days. Scores ranged from 0 to 3, with higher scores indicating greater disease activity. Available scores from the two or three most recent days were averaged and rounded to the nearest integer.\\nBlood samples were drawn prior to vedolizumab infusion at Week 46 [steady-state] to determine trough serum concentrations. Vedolizumab concentrations in serum samples were measured using a direct-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] with a lower limit of detection of 0.125 μg/mL. Faecal samples were collected at Weeks 0, 6, 30 and 52 to determine faecal calprotectin levels using ELISA [CAL0100 Kit].\\nClinical outcomes were analysed using observed cases at Week 52. Patients with missing data points for the Mayo Clinic score were classified as ‘not in remission’.\\nDescriptive statistics were calculated for patient demographics and clinical characteristics. The proportion of patients achieving deep remission (with 95% confidence intervals [CIs]) were derived for each definition. In additional analyses, deep remission rates were stratified by vedolizumab trough serum concentration quartiles at Week 46 and by faecal calprotectin levels [≤50 µg/g, >50–150 µg/g, >150–250 µg/g, >250 µg/g]. Intergroup differences were evaluated with the chi-squared test.\\nA concordance analysis between patient-reported symptoms [RBS and SFS] and ES at Week 52 was carried out by calculating the positive predictive value [PPV], negative predictive value [NPV], sensitivity and specificity for an RBS of 0, SFS subscore of 0 and a composite score [RBS + SFS] of 0.\\nAt Week 6, a total of 373 patients responded to vedolizumab induction therapy and were re-randomized to maintenance placebo (n = 126; median age, 39.9 years [range 18.0–74.0], 45.2% female), vedolizumab Q8W (n = 122; median age, 39.7 years [range 19.0–78.0]; 43.0% female) or vedolizumab Q4W (n = 125; median age, 35.7 years [range 19.0–76.0]; 46.0% female). Baseline demographics and patient characteristics are provided in Table 2.\\nVedolizumab treatment led to statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements at Week 52 compared with placebo, according to all four definitions of deep remission [Figure 1]. At Week 52, at least twice as many vedolizumab-treated patients were in deep remission compared with patients who received placebo. For the most stringent definition of deep remission [definition 1: Mayo Clinic ES = 0, RBS = 0 and decrease in SFS or no change from baseline], 8.7% of patients randomized to placebo for the maintenance phase achieved deep remission compared with 27.0% and 28.0% of those randomised to vedolizumab Q8W [p = 0.0001] and vedolizumab Q4W [p < 0.0001], respectively. For the least stringent definition [definition 4: Mayo Clinic ES ≤ 1, RBS = 0 and SFS ≤ 1], 15.9% of those randomized to placebo achieved deep remission compared with 43.4% and 43.2% of those randomised to vedolizumab Q8W and Q4W, respectively [p < 0.0001 for both comparisons].\\nES during the maintenance phase for the three treatment arms is shown in Figure 2. Among those who had endoscopy at Week 52, 45.5% and 50.6% of patients had an ES of 0 in the vedolizumab Q8W and Q4W groups, respectively, vs 22.4% in the placebo group. For patients with an ES of 0 or 1, the corresponding figures were 81.9% and 83.5%, respectively, vs 51.0%.\\n Figure 3 summarizes the percentages of patients with ES 0–3 at Week 52 by increasing RBS [0–3] [Figure 3A] and SFS [0–3] [Figure 3B]. Among patients with an ES of 0, 100% achieved an RBS of 0 in the vedolizumab Q8W and Q4W groups, as well as in the placebo group. None of the patients with an ES of 0 reported an RBS of 1–3.\\nThe proportion of patients with an ES of 0 who reported an SFS of 0 at Week 52 was 85.0% and 76.0% in the vedolizumab Q8W and Q4W groups, respectively, and 82.0% in the placebo group. A similar proportion of patients with an ES of 0 reported an SFS of 1 [12% in the Q8W group; 22% in the Q4W group; 18% in the placebo group] or 2 [3% in the Q8W group; 3% in the Q4W group; no patients in the placebo group].\\nThe results of the concordance analysis between patient-reported symptoms [RBS and SFS] and ES are shown in Table 3 for the pooled ITT population. For an ES of 0 or 1, combining the RBS and SFS offered the highest PPV, the RBS offered the highest NPV and sensitivity, while the SFS offered higher specificity. The associations were less clear when an ES of 0 was considered. The combination of RBS and SFS still offered the highest PPV and specificity, while both the combined and the individual symptom scores offered high NPV and sensitivity.\\nThere was a trend towards an association of higher rates of deep remission at Week 52 with higher vedolizumab trough steady-state serum concentrations, for all definitions of deep remission. Rates [95% CI] of deep remission for the lowest [<9.26 µg/mL] vs highest [>41 µg/mL] vedolizumab trough serum quartiles, respectively, were as follows: definition 1 [the most stringent definition]: 30.0% [15.8–44.2] vs 47.5% [32.0–63.0]; definition 2: 35.0% [20.2–49.8] vs 57.5% [42.2–72.8]; definition 3: 40.0% [24.8–55.2] vs 67.5% [53.0–82.0]; definition 4 [the least stringent definition]: 47.5% [32.0–63.0] vs 75.0% [61.6–88.4] [Figure 4; Supplementary Table S1]. The placebo group had deep remission rates similar to those of patients with vedolizumab trough serum concentrations in quartile 1 for all definitions.\\nThe proportion of patients achieving deep remission by each definition at Week 6 and stratified by vedolizumab trough serum concentrations at Week 6 are shown in Supplementary Table S2 and Supplementary Figure S2, respectively. Numerically higher rates of deep remission at Week 6 for all four definitions were achieved by patients with the highest vedolizumab trough serum concentrations [quartile 4] at Week 6.\\nRates of deep remission at Week 52 were associated with lower faecal calprotectin levels at Week 52, for all definitions of deep remission [Supplementary Figure S3]. Rates [95% CI] of deep remission for the lowest [≤50 µg/g] vs highest [>250 µg/g] faecal calprotectin levels, respectively, were as follows: definition 1: 59.4% [47.3–71.4] vs 18.6% [7.0–30.2]; definition 2: 62.5% [50.6–74.4] vs 23.3% [10.6–35.9]; definition 3: 71.9% [60.9–82.9] vs 27.9% [14.5–41.3]; definition 4: 82.8% [73.6–92.1] vs 34.9% [20.6–49.1]. It was notable that placebo-treated patients and vedolizumab-treated patients with low faecal calprotectin levels [≤50 µg/g] had similar deep remission rates for all definitions.\\nThe post hoc analysis presented here has shown that patients treated with vedolizumab as maintenance were statistically significantly more likely to achieve deep remission as measured by improvements in endoscopic healing and symptomatic patient-reported outcomes, than were those who received placebo. More than 40% of vedolizumab-treated patients vs up to 15.9% of placebo-receiving patients achieved deep remission after 46 weeks of follow-up. The differences in deep remission rates compared with placebo were statistically significant for each dose regimen of vedolizumab [Q4W and Q8W] and the two dosing regimens were similarly effective. These benefits of vedolizumab treatment were found with respect to all four definitions of deep remission, including the most stringent [definition 1] that required both endoscopic remission and symptomatic improvement. Higher rates of deep remission compared with placebo were also demonstrated using less stringent criteria.\\nThe GEMINI 1 study showed that rates of durable clinical remission and mucosal healing were higher among vedolizumab-treated patients than among placebo-treated patients.\\nThis post hoc analysis of GEMINI 1 data extends these findings by providing an important and clinically relevant perspective on the effectiveness of vedolizumab in achieving deep remission in patients with UC. These data inform a progressive and evolving approach to measuring treatment success that goes beyond the standard phase 3 clinical trial end points. Furthermore, these data support the need for guideline-mediated standardization of criteria for defining deep remission in clinical practice.\\nCurrent recommendations for defining clinical remission in patients with UC include both patient-reported measures [rectal bleeding and stool frequency], which reflect the burden of the disease on patients, and endoscopic measures. The use of both patient-reported and endoscopic measures is supported by the observation that normalization of stool frequency does not always correlate with mucosal healing and, in patients with mucosal healing, the highest quality of life is reported by patients who achieve normalization of stool frequency. The findings from the current study also support this, with some degree of abnormal stool frequency in a proportion of patients with mucosal healing [ES of 0; normal or inactive disease] in both the vedolizumab and the placebo groups. Although UC is traditionally regarded as a disease that is limited to the mucosa, accumulating evidence suggests that fibrosis is a common occurrence in UC. Fibrotic changes are likely to have important clinical consequences, even in the absence of strictures, and may account for the discrepancy between mucosal healing and stool frequency. An analysis of the concordance between the individual symptom scores and ES in the pooled ITT population provides further support for the use of both RBS and SFS in the evaluation of clinical remission. While SFS performed less well in terms of positive prediction and specificity for ES of 0 or of 0/1 [possibly due to irreversibility of increased stool frequency in some patients because of irreversible structural damage], combining SFS with RBS offered the highest PPV, NPV, sensitivity and specificity when considering an ES of 0/1 and the highest PPV and specificity when considering an ES of 0. The importance of including endoscopic healing in definitions of remission in UC is reinforced by studies that have shown endoscopic healing could impact long-term outcomes for patients, such as relapse-free survival, the need for colectomy and future cancer risk. Both the FDA and the EMA accept an ES score of 1 within their criteria for clinical remission. Moreover, professional organizations such as the World Gastroenterology Organization and the American College of Gastroenterology do not provide explicit criteria for defining deep remission. The most recent definition is that issued by ECCO, which describes it as stool frequency ≤3 per day with no bleeding and no mucosal lesions at endoscopy. Consequently, there is a lack of consensus about appropriate definitions of deep remission for use in the evaluation of new treatments for UC or for the evaluation of patients in routine clinical practice.\\nThe current analysis has addressed the issue of a lack of consensus on definitions of deep remission through evaluation of four definitions differing in the stringency of symptomatic and endoscopic criteria. A potential risk of using less stringent criteria to define deep remission is that patients who might benefit from further treatment optimization may be overlooked, with a subsequent negative impact on their long-term outcomes. Such patients may also experience persistent decrements to their health-related quality of life [HRQoL]. A previous post hoc analysis of GEMINI 1 data highlighted that the achievement of clinical remission at Week 52 was associated with improved clinical and HRQoL outcomes. The lack of standardization in defining deep remission further complicates the clinical evaluation of new treatments for UC, because it precludes comparison of deep remission rates across studies using different definitions. A patient defined as being in deep remission in one study may not have met the more stringent criteria applied in another study. In this way, the efficacy of some new treatments may be over-estimated in terms of their potential to optimize long-term outcomes for patients.\\nIn the GEMINI 1 study, patients administered vedolizumab Q4W showed a consistent trend of higher trough serum vedolizumab concentrations compared to patients administered vedolizumab Q8W. The present analysis demonstrates a relationship between vedolizumab pharmacokinetics and deep remission, suggesting a trend towards higher rates of deep remission at Week 52 with higher trough serum steady-state concentrations. Of patients within the top 50% of vedolizumab trough serum concentrations, approximately half achieved the most stringent deep remission criteria [definition 1]. More than 70% of patients achieving the top 75% of vedolizumab trough serum concentrations also achieved the least stringent deep remission criteria [definition 4]. Patients with UC having vedolizumab trough serum concentrations in the upper quartiles [Q2–4] achieved higher rates of deep remission across all definitions compared with those who received vedolizumab during induction and placebo during maintenance. These results are hypothesis-generating only and require confirmation in a larger, prospective analysis.\\nHowever, this relationship is less clear for patients with the lowest vedolizumab trough concentrations [Q1]. The percentages of these patients who achieved deep remission did not differ significantly from those of patients who received vedolizumab during induction and placebo during maintenance across all definitions. Patients with the lowest vedolizumab trough serum concentration may represent a patient subgroup with high drug clearance. Dose optimization may be required to achieve and sustain effective drug concentrations in these patients and is currently being evaluated in a phase 4 open-label study [NCT03029143] in non-responders with moderately to severely active UC.\\nThese observations support another recent evaluation of the relationship between vedolizumab trough concentrations and clinical outcomes utilizing data from the GEMINI 1 study, which found a relationship between higher vedolizumab trough serum concentrations and early [Week 6] clinical remission rates. Interestingly, this latter analysis highlighted that patients who were anti-TNFα-naive were more likely to achieve clinical remission than patients who had failed previous anti-TNFα treatment. An analysis of Week 6 deep remission rates by vedolizumab trough serum concentrations supports the previous evaluation of clinical remission rates, demonstrating a pattern of numerically higher deep remission rates at Week 6 for those achieving higher vedolizumab serum trough concentrations. The relatively low rates of deep remission at Week 6 across all four definitions evaluated in the current study suggest that deep remission may represent a more appropriate target for longer-term maintenance therapy than for acute, induction therapy.\\nFaecal calprotectin is a well-studied biomarker of intestinal inflammation in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. In a recent study of 68 patients with UC, Patel et al. showed that faecal calprotectin levels were significantly associated with disease extent based on the Montreal Classification, Mayo score and Nancy score. These authors also reported that faecal calprotectin levels of ≤60 µg/g predicted deep remission [defined by RBS = 0, SF ≤ 2 and endoscopic Mayo score = 0], with a sensitivity of 86% and a specificity of 87%. The results of the current analysis are consistent with these findings. We have shown that patients with UC who had faecal calprotectin levels ≤50 µg/g had significantly higher rates of deep remission at Week 52 than patients with faecal calprotectin levels >250 µg/g for all definitions of deep remission.\\nA further potential component of any definition of remission in UC is that of histological remission. Preliminary evaluations suggest that histological remission may outperform endoscopic healing as a predictive marker for disease progression and response to therapy. This may be due to the identification of patients with residual microscopic inflammation who are at increased risk for symptomatic relapse than are those with normal histology. Histological remission could represent a more stringent definition for remission in UC for the evaluation of new drug treatments. In this context, it will also be important to understand what differentiates patients who achieve deep remission with therapy from those who do not. Such understanding may inform treatment decisions and expectations, and aid in decisions to modify therapy in patients with persistent symptoms.\\nThe post hoc nature of the analysis and the lack of histological data mandates further evaluation of the ability of vedolizumab to achieve deep and sustained remission in patients with UC. The current analysis is limited by the fact that it did not include an evaluation by prior anti-TNFα antagonist use, which is known to have an impact on other clinical outcomes. The strengths of the current analysis lie in the comparison of a range of definitions of deep remission that varied in stringency of criteria, and the analysis of patients who were randomized and blinded to both induction and maintenance therapy regimen.\\nIn conclusion, this post hoc analysis of data from the phase 3 GEMINI 1 trial conducted in patients with moderately to severely active UC has shown that treatment with vedolizumab was associated with significantly higher rates of deep remission than placebo at Week 52, regardless of dosing frequency or definition of deep remission. More than 40% of vedolizumab-treated patients vs up to 15.9% of those who received placebo achieved deep remission, measured by improvements in endoscopic healing and symptomatic patient-reported outcomes.\\nThis work was supported by Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd.

       "    'fulltext': 'Tumour necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists have revolutionised the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease [IBD]. Although these drugs are considered relatively safe, the increased risk of serious infection remains an important concern. Upper respiratory tract infections [URTIs] are among the most common adverse events [AEs] reported in randomised controlled trials of TNF antagonists, and an increased incidence of URTIs in comparison with placebo has been consistently observed in these studies.\\nPatients with IBD have an increased risk of pneumonia which is further intensified by TNF antagonist therapy. In a retrospective cohort study, the risk of developing pneumonia was approximately 50% higher for patients with IBD [n = 108604] than for the general population (n = 434416; hazard ratio [HR] 1.54; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.49–1.60), and among those with IBD, TNF antagonist therapy was independently associated with pneumonia (odds ratio [OR] 1.28; 95% CI: 1.08–1.52). In a US hospitalisation database, 27.5% of all Crohn’s disease [CD]- or ulcerative colitis [UC]-related hospitalisations were attributable to infection. These patients had excess mortality risks compared with patients without infection-related hospitalisations, which varied depending on the infection type; pneumonia had one of the highest excess mortality risks compared with patients without infection-related hospitalisation [OR 3.6; 95% CI: 2.9–4.5]. An analysis of the TREAT™ registry, which evaluated 6273 patients with CD over a mean follow-up of 5.2 years, found that infliximab therapy was independently associated with an increased risk of serious infection (2.06 events per 100 patient-years [HR 1.43; 95% CI: 1.11–1.84; p = 0.006]). The most common serious infection was pneumonia, with an incidence of 0.24 cases per 100 patient-years of follow-up in infliximab-treated patients compared with a rate of 0.14 cases per 100 patient-years of follow-up for those on treatments other than infliximab. Similarly, in the ENCORE registry, which followed 1541 infliximab-treated patients with CD for up to 5 years, infliximab therapy was independently associated with an increased risk of serious infection [HR 1.64; 95% CI: 1.17–2.31], and the most common AEs were abscess and pneumonia.\\nVedolizumab, a humanised monoclonal antibody that binds to the α4β7 integrin and selectively blocks lymphocyte trafficking to the gut, has been shown to be an effective induction and maintenance therapy for both UC and CD. Unlike thiopurines, methotrexate, and TNF antagonists, the gut-selective mechanism of action of vedolizumab does not result in systemic immunosuppression. Although a previous evaluation of the safety of vedolizumab did not identify an increased risk of respiratory tract infection [RTI], the estimates used in that study were based on simple incidence rates and were not adjusted for important covariates such as smoking status and age. Given the previously described increase in risk associated with TNF antagonists, it is important to accurately estimate the incidence of RTIs in patients treated with vedolizumab. We used an integrated dataset derived from placebo-controlled trials to obtain such estimates.\\nData from two Phase 3, randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trials of vedolizumab, GEMINI 1 [UC] and GEMINI 2 [CD], were analysed for rates of URTIs and LRTIs. GEMINI 1 and 2 evaluated the efficacy and safety of vedolizumab 300 mg or placebo as induction and maintenance therapy for up to 52 weeks. The study designs and outcomes of these trials have been described previously. In this analysis, the vedolizumab study population [n = 1434] included all patients who were responders to vedolizumab induction therapy and were subsequently randomised to vedolizumab maintenance therapy [every 4 or 8 weeks] at Week 6, and also those who received induction therapy with vedolizumab, did not achieve clinical response at Week 6, and were then assigned to vedolizumab every 4 weeks for the maintenance phase. The placebo population [n = 297] comprised patients who received placebo during the induction phase and were subsequently assigned to continue placebo during the maintenance phase.\\nTo evaluate the incidence of RTI beyond 52 weeks of treatment with vedolizumab, we also included data from the GEMINI long-term safety [LTS] trial, which evaluated the safety of vedolizumab 300 mg administered every 4 weeks in adult patients: ‘rollover’ patients from GEMINI 1 [n = 675], GEMINI 2 [n = 726], GEMINI 3 [n = 384], and a Phase 2 extension study [n = 37]; as well as a population of patients [n = 421] who were naïve to vedolizumab treatment [de novo patients]. Data have previously been reported from the GEMINI LTS trial, also referred to as the long-term safety [LTS] study, for the period May 22, 2009 to June 27, 2013. Follow-up in the study continues and data reported here are from an interim analysis of the data up to May 19, 2015; at this time, 2243 patients had been enrolled [1349 with CD and 894 with UC], constituting 5430 patient-years of follow-up with a median of 981 days’ total exposure to vedolizumab [range 1–2677 days]. Data from the safety population [all patients who received at least one dose of vedolizumab in the GEMINI LTS trial] were analysed. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were as previously reported.\\nBased on the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities [MedDRA; version 14.0] high-level terms [HLTs] ‘upper respiratory tract infection’ and ‘lower respiratory tract and lung infection’, the incidence of AEs, serious AEs [SAEs], and AEs leading to discontinuation were analysed for each of the GEMINI studies [Supplementary Table 1, available as Supplementary data at ECCO-JCC online]. SAEs were defined as those occurring at any dose, regardless of causality, which: were life-threatening or resulted in death; required inpatient hospitalization; resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, congenital anomaly or birth defect; jeopardised the patient and required medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the above; or involved suspected transmission of an infectious agent. For this analysis, ‘LRTI’ is used as an abbreviation for the MedDRA HLT ‘lower respiratory tract and lung infection’, and ‘events’ refers to AEs. Data for the maintenance phase only were analysed for GEMINI 1 and 2, as well as the LTS trial [including exposure from previous trials]. Exposure-adjusted incidence rates per 100 patient-years were calculated for the incidence of patients with any AE or SAE within the HLTs, as well as for each individual MedDRA preferred term within these. LRTI AEs were analysed by duration of vedolizumab exposure, for the GEMINI LTS trial to evaluate trends over time. The times to first URTI and LRTI event for the GEMINI 1, 2, and LTS trials were also evaluated.\\nMultivariate logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards modelling were used to identify predictors for the occurrence of any RTI, any URTI, or any LRTI in the individual and pooled GEMINI 1 and GEMINI 2 studies. Predictors assessed were: age; sex; disease duration; previous TNF antagonist use; baseline disease activity; concomitant use of narcotics, corticosteroids, or immunosuppressives; smoking history; and occurrence of surgery during the study. Both unadjusted and adjusted models were evaluated.\\nDemographics and baseline characteristics are summarised in Table 1. The mean [standard deviation] exposure to study drug was 228 [132] days for vedolizumab and 154 [119] days for placebo in GEMINI 1 [UC], 203 [136] days for vedolizumab and 172 [129] days for placebo in GEMINI 2 [CD], and 1046 [688] and 915 [656] days for patients with UC and CD, respectively, in GEMINI LTS [including exposure from previous studies].\\nNo statistically significant differences in time to first lower/upper RTI were observed between patients assigned to vedolizumab therapy and those who received placebo [Figure 1A; HR 1.22, log-rank p = 0.162].\\nNo statistically significant differences in time to first URTI were observed between patients assigned to vedolizumab therapy and those who received placebo [Figure 1B; HR 1.23, log-rank p = 0.173]. Unadjusted multivariable logistic regression analyses identified previous TNF antagonist use [HR 1.50; 95% CI: 1.20–1.88; p < 0.001], smoking [current smokers, HR 1.35; 95% CI: 1.04–1.75; p = 0.023], and concomitant narcotic use [HR 1.30; 95% CI: 1.04–1.64; p = 0.022] as significant risk factors for the development of a URTI in the pooled GEMINI 1 and 2 population. After adjustment for level of disease activity, these risk factors were still significant: previous TNF antagonist use [HR 1.53; 95% CI: 1.20–1.95; p = 0.0007]; smoking [current smokers, HR 1.35; 95% CI: 1.03–1.78; p = 0.0316]; and concomitant narcotic use [HR 1.28; 95% CI: 1.00–1.63; p = 0.046].\\nThe exposure-adjusted incidence rate of URTIs was numerically lower among patients who received placebo compared with those who received vedolizumab, although the difference was small and not statistically significant [38.7 vs 33.0 patients per 100 patient-years [HR 1.12; 95% CI: 0.83–1.51; p = 0.463]; Figure 2 and Supplementary Table 2, available as Supplementary data at ECCO-JCC online]. Two patients who received vedolizumab had a serious URTI and one patient discontinued treatment due to laryngitis [Supplementary Table 2]. No patients receiving placebo had a serious URTI or discontinued therapy due to a URTI [Supplementary Table 2]. No deaths from URTIs occurred in either group.\\nThe most frequently reported URTI, nasopharyngitis, occurred at a higher rate in the vedolizumab group than in patients who received placebo [18.6 vs 12.8 patients per 100 patient-years in the pooled GEMINI 1 and 2 populations; Table 2]. URTI was the next most common URTI [MedDRA preferred term] and the incidence rate was similar for vedolizumab-treated and placebo-receiving patients [10.5 vs 11.6 patients per 100 patient-years].\\nNo statistically significant differences in time to first LRTI were observed between patients assigned to vedolizumab therapy and those who received placebo [Figure 1C; HR 0.95, log-rank p = 0.851]. In unadjusted multivariable logistic regression analyses, previous TNF antagonist use [HR 2.20; 95% CI: 1.10–4.41; p = 0.027] and female sex [HR 2.11; 95% CI: 1.07–4.14; p = 0.030] were associated with LRTI in patients with UC, whereas in the CD population, current smoker status alone was associated with the occurrence of LRTI [HR 2.37; 95% CI: 1.26–4.45; p = 0.008; Table 3]. A higher proportion of patients with CD were current smokers compared with those with UC [29.2% of females and 22.3% of males in GEMINI 2; 4.2% of females and 7.5% of males in GEMINI 1]. Vedolizumab therapy, age, disease duration, baseline disease activity, or concomitant narcotic, corticosteroid, and immunosuppressive use were not associated with a significantly greater risk of LRTI. After adjustment for disease activity, none of the evaluated risk factors were significant predictors of LRTI in patients with UC [Table 4]. However, smoking [current smokers, HR 3.43; 95% CI: 1.67–7.04; p = 0.0008] remained a significant predictor of LRTI in patients with CD.\\nThe exposure-adjusted incidence rate of LRTIs was numerically lower for vedolizumab-treated patients than for placebo recipients in the pooled GEMINI 1 and GEMINI 2 analysis, although this difference was not statistically significant (7.7 vs 8.5 patients per 100 patient-years [HR 0.85; 95% CI: 0.48–1.52; p = 0.585]; Figure 2 and Supplementary Table 2). The rate [95% CI] of serious LRTIs was low in both vedolizumab and placebo groups (0.5 [0.1–0.9] and 0.6 [0.0–1.7] patients per 100 patient-years, respectively; Supplementary Table 2). There were two LRTI-related discontinuations in the vedolizumab group [bronchitis and pneumonia, both in patients with CD] compared with none in the placebo group [Supplementary Table 2]. There was one LRTI-related death, which occurred in a patient receiving placebo who died from bronchopneumonia. Patients with UC who received treatment with vedolizumab had a statistically non-significant lower rate of LRTIs compared with those receiving placebo (6.8 vs 9.0 per 100 patient-years [HR 0.72; 95% CI: 0.31–1.69; p = 0.452]; Figure 2 and Table 3). For patients with CD, the corresponding rates were 8.5 and 8.0 per 100 patient-years for the vedolizumab and placebo groups, respectively [HR 0.94; 95% CI: 0.42–2.10; p = 0. 872; Table 3]. Bronchitis was the most frequently reported LRTI in both the vedolizumab and the placebo groups in the GEMINI 1 and 2 populations. The rate was similar for the vedolizumab and placebo groups in the pooled GEMINI 1 and 2 data analysis (5.5 vs 6.0 patients per 100 patient-years [HR 0.84; 95% CI: 0.42–1.66; p = 0.607]; Table 2). Overall the incidence rates [95% CI] of pneumonia, bronchopneumonia, and primary atypical pneumonia were similar with vedolizumab therapy compared with placebo (1.0 [0.4–1.7] vs 1.2 [0.0–2.8], 0.1 [0.0–0.3] vs 0.6 [0.0–1.7], and 0.1 [0.0–0.3] vs 0 patients per 100 patient-years, respectively; Table 2). Two of these events in the vedolizumab group were serious, both in patients with CD. The fatal event of bronchopneumonia in a patient with CD was the only serious event in the placebo group.\\nNo statistically significant differences were observed between patients assigned to vedolizumab maintenance therapy every 4 weeks vs every 8 weeks in time to first RTI [Figure 3A; HR 0.98, log-rank p = 0.864], time to first URTI [Figure 3B; HR 0.98, log-rank p = 0.902] or time to first LRTI [Figure 3C; HR 1.20, log-rank p = 0.531]. Similarly, no significant between-group differences were found in exposure-adjusted incidence rates of RTI, URTI, or LRTI [Figure 4].\\nTwo patients who received vedolizumab maintenance therapy every 4 weeks had a serious URTI and one patient discontinued treatment due to a serious URTI [Supplementary Table 3, available as Supplementary data at ECCO-JCC online]. No patients receiving vedolizumab maintenance therapy every 8 weeks had a serious URTI and no patients discontinued therapy due to a serious URTI [Supplementary Table 3]. Three patients who received vedolizumab maintenance therapy every 4 weeks had a serious LRTI and one patient discontinued treatment due to serious LRTI [Supplementary Table 3]. Finally, two patients receiving vedolizumab maintenance therapy every 8 weeks had a serious LRTI and no patients discontinued therapy due to a serious LRTI [Supplementary Table 3].\\nThe most frequently reported URTI, nasopharyngitis, occurred at a slightly lower rate in the vedolizumab 4-week group than in the vedolizumab 8-week group [18.1 vs 20.8 patients per 100 patient-years in the pooled GEMINI 1 and 2 populations; Table 3]. Upper respiratory tract infection was the next most common URTI [MedDRA preferred term] and the incidence rate was similar in the vedolizumab 4-week and vedolizumab 8-week treatment groups [10.9 vs 9.0 patients per 100 patient-years]. Bronchitis was the most frequently reported LRTI in both the vedolizumab 4-week and vedolizumab 8-week treatment groups in the GEMINI 1 and 2 studies. The rate of bronchitis was similar for both groups in the pooled GEMINI 1 and 2 data analysis [5.52 vs 5.57 patients per 100 patient-years; Table 3]. Overall the incidence rates [95% CIs] of pneumonia, bronchopneumonia, and primary atypical pneumonia were similar with vedolizumab 4-week maintenance therapy compared with vedolizumab 8-week maintenance therapy (1.1 [0.4─1.8] vs 0.9 [0─2.2], 0.1 [0.0–0.4] vs 0, and 0.1 [0─0.4] vs 0 patients per 100 patient-years, respectively; Table 3). Two of the pneumonia events in the vedolizumab 4-week group and one of the bronchitis events in the vedolizumab 8-week group were serious.\\nIn the GEMINI LTS trial, exposure-adjusted incidence rates for URTI [95% CI] were numerically lower for vedolizumab-treated patients with UC than for those with CD (22.3 [19.7–24.9] vs 24.3 [22.0–26.7] events per 100 patient-years; Figure 2 and Supplementary Table 2). Nasopharyngitis and URTI [MedDRA preferred term] were the most frequent URTI events [Table 2].\\nThere was no increase in the incidence rates [95% CI] of LRTIs in the GEMINI LTS trial relative to those in the pooled GEMINI 1 and 2 data analysis (5.0 [4.4–5.6] vs 7.7 [6.0–9.4]). The incidence rates [95% CI] of pneumonia, bronchopneumonia, primary atypical pneumonia, and lobar pneumonia in vedolizumab-treated patients were 0.9 [0.7–1.2], <0.1 [0.0–0.1], <0.1 [0.0–0.1], and 0.1 [<0.1–0.2] events per 100 patient-years, respectively [Table 2].\\nIn the GEMINI LTS trial, the proportion of patients with reported respiratory infection declined over time: from 24.8% during months 0–12 to 9.6% during months 60–72 for URTI events, and from 5.7% during months 0–12 to 1.1% during months 60–72 for LRTI events [Table 5].\\nOur results show that, in the GEMINI 1 and 2 studies, vedolizumab therapy was not associated with significantly higher rates of RTI. Most of the URTIs and LRTIs that occurred in patients receiving vedolizumab were not serious and did not result in treatment discontinuation. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards modelling showed that, unlike smoking or previous exposure to TNF antagonist therapy, vedolizumab therapy was not a risk factor for LRTI events, in either UC or CD. Moreover, analysis of vedolizumab serum concentrations did not reveal any significant association or consistent trends between vedolizumab quartile levels and RTIs, URTIs, or LRTIs [unpublished data]. These results are consistent with a meta-analysis of pooled data from six randomised placebo-controlled clinical trials in patients with IBD, which found no significant differences between vedolizumab and placebo in the risk of all serious infections [relative risk 1.17; 95% CI: 0.51–2.69].\\nPneumonia is an event of particular interest, and rates were low in these post hoc analyses, with most classified as non-serious. Of the 11/1434 vedolizumab-treated patients in GEMINI 1 and 2 who had pneumonia, the event was considered serious in two patients. In the GEMINI LTS trial, of the 49/2243 patients who had pneumonia events [0.92 per 100 patient-years], 18 were considered to have serious pneumonia [0.33 per 100 patient-years]. One patient discontinued vedolizumab due to pneumonia. The data suggest that long-term vedolizumab therapy does not have any progressive or cumulative effect on susceptibility to pneumonia. These findings are consistent with the gut-selective mechanism of action of vedolizumab and lack of systemic immunosuppressive effects. The comparator group comprised patients who responded to placebo and were subsequently maintained on placebo, suggesting a relatively lower disease severity that would, if anything, bias the study toward finding an increase in pneumonia risk with vedolizumab exposure. This finding also provides greater confidence in the conclusion that vedolizumab was not associated with a greater risk of pneumonia. Although previous studies had suggested a potential increased risk of URTI for vedolizumab, based on mucosal vascular addressin cell adhesion molecule 1 [MAdCAM-1] expression in the oropharynx, our results do not support a clinically relevant corollary of this finding.\\nAn increased risk of RTI is one limitation of TNF antagonist therapy. Due to their systemic immunosuppressive mode of action, patients exposed to these agents have an increased risk of URTI and LRTI, serious RTIs, and pneumonia-related mortality. It is difficult to make an indirect comparison of the absolute rates of URTI and LRTI events observed in this analysis with those from pivotal trials of TNF antagonists in IBD [Supplementary Table 4] for several reasons. First, published reports provide only sparse details regarding these events, and rates of occurrence are expressed as simple proportions rather than exposure-adjusted rates. Second, publications often provide rates for common AEs only—typically those that occurred in >5% of patients. Usually the incidence of LRTIs does not meet this criterion. Consequently, little attention has been drawn to the issue of RTIs in patients receiving TNF antagonists despite observations that LRTIs, and specifically pneumonia, are among the most common serious infections associated with the use of these agents.\\nRisk factors associated with the occurrence of pneumonia include smoking and TNF antagonist therapy. Consistent with this, our analysis identified smoking status, previous use of TNF antagonists, and female sex as independent risk factors for LRTI. In both UC and CD, cigarette smoking was identified as a risk factor for both URTI and LRTI. Although this finding requires little explanation, it is concerning that the prevalence of cigarette smoking remains high in patients with CD. A higher proportion of patients with CD were current smokers compared with those with UC. In GEMINI 1 [UC], 4.2% of females and 7.5% of males were current smokers compared with 29.2% of females and 22.3% of males in GEMINI 2 [CD]. Accordingly, measures to reduce the known risk factors for RTI should be implemented, including referral to smoking cessation programmes, administration of vaccines, and judicious use of systemic immunosuppression in these patients.\\nBoth the pooled GEMINI 1 and 2 population and patients with UC were more likely to have an LRTI if they had had previous TNF antagonist exposure, despite implementation of a washout period before randomisation [Table 3]. However, there is some evidence to suggest that previous TNF antagonist therapy in patients with rheumatoid arthritis is associated with serious infection, and switching from a TNF antagonist to a treatment with an alternative mechanism of action may reduce the risks of infection. An explanation for these observations is not readily apparent. However, patients with previous TNF antagonist exposure may be at greater risk for RTIs because of longer disease duration, slightly greater baseline disease activity, and greater use of additional therapies such as corticosteroids, compared with patients without previous exposure [Supplementary Table 5, available as Supplementary data at ECCO-JCC online].\\nThe GEMINI LTS trial provides insight into the risks of long-term exposure to vedolizumab (5430 patient-years to interim analysis date [May 19, 2015]). Rates of URTI and LRTI events were generally lower than those in the GEMINI 1 and 2 studies, and exhibited similar patterns. These lower rates may reflect the improvement in general health in patients responding to long-term vedolizumab therapy. The importance of accruing data from a large number of patients with a long follow-up time, thereby improving sensitivity to rare or delayed safety concerns, should be balanced with the limitations of LTS studies, such as lack of a reference arm. Ongoing registry evaluations, such as the recently initiated ENTYVIO® Outcomes in Real-world Bio-naïve Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn’s Disease Patients [EVOLVE], will provide insight on treatment patterns and outcomes for patients.\\nIn summary, this post hoc analysis of controlled trials and their LTS study provides a comprehensive assessment of LRTIs and URTIs in almost 6500 patient-years of exposure to vedolizumab for the treatment of IBD. Vedolizumab therapy was not associated with an increased incidence of LRTIs compared with placebo.\\nThis work was supported by Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd.

       "    'fulltext': 'The treatment goals for patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) include inducing and maintaining clinical remission and avoiding complications, hospitalization, and surgery. Biological agents used for the treatment of IBD, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists, are associated with systemic immunosuppression. The risk of opportunistic infections in IBD increases with the use of biologics (odds ratio 1.9), including TNF antagonists. Opportunistic infections have been reported among patients with IBD receiving TNF antagonists (with incidence rates [IR] per 100 patient-years [PY] of exposure) and include candidiasis (IR 1.7), herpes simplex (IR 1.1), herpes zoster (IR 1.1), abdominal abscess (IR 0.9), sepsis (IR 0.8), Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) colitis/diarrhea (IR 0.4), histoplasmosis (IR 0.1), and cytomegalovirus (CMV) colitis (IR <0.1). In particular, TNF antagonist use is associated with an increased risk of new tuberculosis infection and reactivation of latent tuberculosis. In TNF antagonist-treated patients with IBD, 1.7% and 3.1% of patients in studies conducted in Spain and the Republic of Korea, respectively, developed tuberculosis (general population incidence in 2015: 12/100,000 population [Spain]; 80/100,000 population [Korea]). TNF antagonists could also predispose to reactivation of viral hepatitis, especially hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. The frequency of HBV reactivation reported in patients with IBD receiving immunosuppressive therapy varied from 17% (1 in 6 patients) to 36% (9 in 25 patients); HBV reactivation was significantly associated with treatment with more than one immunosuppressive therapy, particularly when one of the therapies was a TNF antagonist.\\nVedolizumab (ENTYVIO; Takeda Pharmaceuticals, Deerfield, IL) is a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets α4β7 integrin and selectively blocks the interaction of α4β7 with mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1, thereby inhibiting the migration of memory T lymphocytes across the endothelium into inflamed gastrointestinal tissue. Vedolizumab is approved for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease. The gut-selective mode of action of vedolizumab should theoretically be associated with a lower risk of infections. An integrated analysis of safety data from 6 vedolizumab clinical trials reported that vedolizumab was not associated with an increased risk of opportunistic infections compared with placebo, and tuberculosis was also reported infrequently (0.1/100 PY, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.0–0.2). The clinical trials had excluded patients with chronic HBV or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Thus, clinical evidence on the risk of reactivation of HBV or HCV infection with vedolizumab therapy has so far been lacking.\\nSafety data have been collected from an ongoing long-term safety study of vedolizumab in IBD and, since the market approval of vedolizumab in May 2014, additional safety data have also been collected from post-marketing surveillance. Taken together, these data provide further insights on the long-term safety of vedolizumab.\\nHere, we report the frequency of opportunistic infections and tuberculosis in patients treated with vedolizumab in clinical trials and the post-marketing setting. The adverse event profile observed in patients with a history of or concurrent HBV or HCV infection who had received vedolizumab in the post-marketing setting was also characterized.\\nSafety data were obtained from 2 randomized, placebo-controlled trials of vedolizumab for ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease (GEMINI 1 and GEMINI 2, respectively), an ongoing long-term safety (LTS) study, and the vedolizumab Global Safety Database (Figure 1). Data from the GEMINI 1 and GEMINI 2 clinical trials were pooled. In the clinical trials, patients were excluded if they had active or latent tuberculosis at screening, evidenced by a history of tuberculosis, a positive diagnostic tuberculosis test within 1 month prior to enrollment, or a chest radiograph within 3 months of enrollment in which active or latent tuberculosis could not be excluded. The clinical trials excluded patients with chronic HBV or HCV infection, so safety data from patients with a history of HBV or HCV infection reflect the post-marketing setting only.\\nPatients enrolled in clinical trials, postauthorization safety studies, and patient support and market research programs provided informed consent for participation in the studies, including the collection of adverse event data. Institutional Review Board review and approvals were obtained for these studies.\\nThese phase 3 clinical trials were designed to assess the efficacy and safety of vedolizumab 300 mg IV vs placebo as induction (at Week 0 and Week 2) and maintenance therapy (4-weekly or 8-weekly IV injections from Week 6 up to Week 52). The eligibility criteria for these studies have been reported previously. In brief, patients had moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease and a history of unsuccessful treatment with one or more of immunomodulators, TNF antagonists, or corticosteroids.\\nThe GEMINI LTS study was designed to evaluate the long-term safety of vedolizumab 300 mg IV every 4 weeks and enrolled patients with ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease who had previously participated in vedolizumab clinical trials (GEMINI 1, GEMINI 2, GEMINI 3 [a phase 3, 10-week, placebo-controlled, induction trial in patients with Crohn’s disease], or a phase 2 extension study) as well as patients who were vedolizumab-naïve (de novo patients). The eligibility criteria for this study have been reported elsewhere. The LTS study was ongoing when this interim analysis, which includes data up to May 21, 2015, was performed.\\nAll individual case safety reports of adverse events experienced in patients treated with vedolizumab that are reported to Takeda are held in the vedolizumab Global Safety Database. Sources of data held in the vedolizumab Global Safety Database include spontaneous reports received directly from patients, healthcare professionals, or regulatory authorities; reports in the scientific and medical literature; and solicited reports from patient support programs and market research programs. Upon receipt of a report, Takeda reviews the data and requests additional information required to evaluate the adverse event(s). The vedolizumab Global Safety Database was searched to identify post-marketing safety reports received up to May 19, 2017.\\nOpportunistic infections were identified using a search query (see Table, Supplemental Digital Content 1) based on a comprehensive list of preferred terms commonly regarded as opportunistic infections from the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA; MedDRA version 14.0 for clinical trial data and MedDRA version 20.0 for data from the vedolizumab Global Safety Database [the opportunistic infections queried were the same for both sets of data]). A serious adverse event was defined in line with the FDA Code of Federal Regulations. In the GEMINI clinical trials, any diagnosis of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy would have been considered a serious adverse event.\\nTuberculosis infections were classified according to MedDRA version 14.0 in the clinical trials and version 20.0 in the post-marketing setting (using the high-level term group tuberculous infections). The distinction between primary tuberculosis infection and reactivation of latent tuberculosis was based on patients’ medical history and concurrent conditions, diagnostic tests (QuantiFERON or tuberculin skin test), and chest radiography. These assessments were made by the investigator for patients enrolled in clinical trials and by the reporter in the post-marketing setting.\\nThe clinical trials excluded patients with chronic HBV or HCV infection, but in the post-marketing setting, there were patients with a medical history of hepatitis infection who were treated with vedolizumab. Patients with a history of or concurrent HBV or HCV infection who had an adverse event reported to Takeda after receiving vedolizumab were identified in the Global Safety Database using the MedDRA version 20.0 high-level term group hepatitis viral infections and the MedDRA preferred term viral hepatitis carrier. Only patients with a reported history of or concurrent HBV or HCV infection or both were included in this analysis. Patients with a history of or concurrent hepatitis A, with hepatitis B vaccination, or unspecified hepatitis were excluded.\\nThe clinical trial population for the GEMINI 1 and GEMINI 2 trials included patients who had received the same treatment (ie, placebo or vedolizumab only) in both induction and maintenance phases of the respective trials. Patients in the GEMINI LTS study included rollover patients from a previous qualifying study (patients with ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease who participated in the phase 2, open-label, long-term safety study [C13004], patients who withdrew early from GEMINI 1 or GEMINI 2 due to sustained nonresponse, disease worsening, or the need for rescue medications, or patients who completed GEMINI 1, GEMINI 2, or GEMINI 3 trials) and de novo patients (ie, those with ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease who met the inclusion/exclusion criteria).\\nRates of infections were calculated as exposure-adjusted incidence rates (rate per 100 PY = [number of patients experiencing an adverse event of interest / total patient exposure time in years] × 100). Additionally, the incidence of infections in percentages was provided for completeness.\\nDetails of adverse events reported in clinical trials were summarized, including their intensity (mild, moderate, or severe), seriousness (serious or nonserious), and relationship to the study drug (as determined by the investigator).\\nIn the post-marketing setting, adverse events were summarized in tables by the preferred term and seriousness.\\nFor the 52-week GEMINI 1 and GEMINI 2 clinical trials, 1434 patients who received vedolizumab (reflecting 1058.2 total patient-years [TPY] of vedolizumab exposure) and 297 patients who received placebo (171.3 TPY of placebo exposure) were included in the analysis. The mean (standard deviation [SD]) duration of exposure to vedolizumab was 258.5 ± 118.0 days and 246.8 ± 112.4 days in GEMINI 1 and GEMINI 2, respectively. Placebo was received for 181.4 ± 118.4 days and 203.0 ± 127.0 days in GEMINI 1 and GEMINI 2, respectively. A total of 59.0% of vedolizumab-treated patients from GEMINI 1 and GEMINI 2 had prior exposure to TNF antagonists compared with 48.8% of patients who received placebo.\\nA total 2243 patients in the LTS study received at least one dose of vedolizumab (5430.3 TPY of exposure). The patient population consisted of 894 patients with ulcerative colitis and 1349 patients with Crohn’s disease. At the data cut-off for the analysis, the mean (SD) duration of exposure to vedolizumab was 1046.2 ± 688.4 days for patients with ulcerative colitis and 914.7 ± 655.9 days for those with Crohn’s disease. From the LTS study, 46.4% of patients with ulcerative colitis and 66.6% with Crohn’s disease had prior exposure to TNF antagonists.\\nThe Global Safety Database reflected an estimated 114,071 PY of vedolizumab exposure at the data cut-off.\\nIn the randomized, controlled phase 3 trials, opportunistic infections were reported in 7 of 1434 patients (0.5%) exposed to vedolizumab, with over 1058.2 TPY of vedolizumab exposure (incidence 0.7/100 PY; Table 1). The infections reported were C. difficile colitis/infection (n = 5), CMV colitis (n = 1), and CMV infection (n = 1); 0.5, 0.1, and 0.1 per 100 PY, respectively. No opportunistic infections were reported in patients receiving placebo (in 171.3 TPY of exposure).\\nSeven patients reporting an opportunistic infection had a median age of 39 years (range 31–45 years); of these, 4 were female and 6 had prior exposure to TNF antagonists. The median time from the first vedolizumab infusion to the occurrence of an opportunistic infection was 85 days (range 29–449 days) and the most recent vedolizumab infusion was administered a median of 15 days (range 10–101 days) before an opportunistic infection was reported.\\nAll reported opportunistic infections were mild (n = 2) to moderate (n = 5) in intensity, none were fatal, and in all but one patient, they were considered nonserious events. A 39-year-old female patient with Crohn’s disease who was previously treated with TNF antagonist therapy had a serious event of C. difficile colitis that involved hospitalization and treatment with metronidazole (during the event, the patient also received ciprofloxacin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, levomepromazine, tramadol hydrochloride, and glycerol). The infection was resolved within 7 days and vedolizumab treatment was continued. One patient discontinued the study due to a C. difficile infection, although the infection was considered nonserious.\\nThe opportunistic infections described were reported from France and the United States (2 patients each), and from Canada, Austria, and Hungary (1 patient each).\\nIn the GEMINI LTS study, opportunistic infections were reported in 2.3% of patients (51 of 2243; 27 ulcerative colitis, 24 Crohn’s disease), with over 5430.3 TPY of vedolizumab exposure. The 51 patients with IBD reporting opportunistic infections had a median age of 41.1 years (range 19–72), 34 were female, and 40 had prior exposure to a TNF antagonist. The incidence rates in ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease were 1.2 per 100 PY and 0.8 per 100 PY, respectively. C. difficile colitis was the most frequently reported opportunistic infection, reported in 27 patients (incidence 0.5 per 100 PY; Table 1).\\nNone of the reported opportunistic infections were fatal. There were 20 serious opportunistic infections among 18 patients with IBD, including C. difficile colitis (12 patients), CMV colitis (3 patients), clostridial infection (4 patients), and esophageal candidiasis (1 patient). Two of the 18 patients reported 2 serious events each (C. difficile colitis and CMV colitis in one patient, and C. difficile colitis and clostridial infection in the other). Opportunistic infections resulted in vedolizumab discontinuation in only 7.8% of patients (4 of 51).\\nThe number of PY of exposure to vedolizumab in the post-marketing setting is an approximation based on shipping data; it is assumed that each patient received vedolizumab 300 mg (1 vial) every 8 weeks. In the context of approximately 114,071 PY of vedolizumab therapy in the post-marketing setting, opportunistic infections were reported in 210 patients (Table 2). Of 217 total events reported in these patients, the most frequent were C. difficile infection (83 nonserious, 44 serious events) and CMV infection (6 nonserious, 14 serious events).\\nThe median age of patients who had an opportunistic infection was 39 years (range 9–85 years; where age was reported) and 99 of 183 patients (for whom sex was reported) were male. Of the 210 patients, 99 had a confirmed medication history of prior/concomitant exposure to TNF antagonists, 104 had confirmed prior/concomitant exposure to steroids, and 76 had confirmed prior/concomitant exposure to other immunosuppressive therapies. In most cases, the duration between the first or final vedolizumab dose and the adverse event was not reported. In those reports that contained this information, most opportunistic infections occurred at least 1 month after the first vedolizumab infusion (62 of 79 reports) and within 0 to 13 days of the most recent infusion (15 of 20 reports).\\nAmong the opportunistic infections reported, 104 were considered serious, including 2 events that resulted in death: one patient developed Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia due to long-term, high-dose steroid use, and a second patient with steroid-refractory graft-versus-host disease who was using vedolizumab off-label developed an unspecified opportunistic infection in addition to an existing CMV infection. Vedolizumab therapy was continued after the opportunistic infection in 101 of 158 patients (no available data on treatment continuation in 52 patients). There have been no cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy reported with vedolizumab treatment to date.\\nMost of the reports were from Canada (85 patients; approximately 5882 PY of vedolizumab exposure) and the United States (78 patients; approximately 61,488 PY of vedolizumab exposure).\\nTuberculosis was reported in 1 patient during GEMINI 2 and 4 patients in the LTS study (2 with latent tuberculosis and 3 with pulmonary tuberculosis; incidence rate across all clinical trials: 0.1 per 100 PY; Table 3), all of whom had received vedolizumab.\\nThe median age of patients with tuberculosis was 30 years (range 19–38 years) and of the 5 patients, 2 were female. The median time from the first infusion to the occurrence of tuberculosis was 105 days (range 46–938 days). Two of the 5 patients had prior exposure to TNF antagonists (a 30-year old who had received infliximab and a 23-year old who had received infliximab [the dates of TNF antagonist exposure were not reported]).\\nAll adverse events were reported as mild or moderate in intensity, none were fatal, and none of the patients had extra-pulmonary tuberculosis (Table 3). Tuberculosis resulted in discontinuation of vedolizumab treatment in 4 of the 5 patients (vedolizumab discontinuation under these circumstances was mandated by the clinical trial protocols). The fifth patient had discontinued vedolizumab before the onset of tuberculosis because of a lack of treatment efficacy. All 5 adverse events of tuberculosis were reported from countries known to be moderately or highly endemic for tuberculosis, including Czech Republic, India, Republic of Korea, Russian Federation, and Slovakia (1 patient in each country; the total vedolizumab exposure by country was 314.9 PY, 145.0 PY, 110.4 PY, 170.1 PY, and 56.2 PY, respectively).\\nIn the context of approximately 114,071 PY of vedolizumab therapy, 7 adverse events of tuberculosis were reported in 7 patients (Table 4).\\nAge was reported for 3 patients (20, 33, and 46 years). Three patients were female and 3 were male (sex not reported for 1 patient). Four patients with tuberculosis had received TNF antagonists prior to treatment with vedolizumab (1 patient last received treatment with infliximab 98 days before being hospitalized with suspicion of tuberculosis; 1 discontinued treatment with infliximab 175 days before the onset of tuberculosis and adalimumab approximately 14 months before the onset of the event; 1 received adalimumab [treatment dates not reported]; and 1 received an unspecified TNF antagonist [treatment dates not reported]). Where reported, the time range from the first vedolizumab infusion to the occurrence of tuberculosis was 48–196 days.\\nAlthough tuberculosis is a significant medical event, 2 adverse events were assessed by the reporter as nonserious. Three patients discontinued treatment with vedolizumab after the diagnosis of tuberculosis, 1 continued treatment after diagnosis, 2 discontinued treatment and later restarted (the product label recommends discontinuation until tuberculosis is resolved), and in 1 of the patients the outcome was not reported.\\nThe adverse events of tuberculosis occurred in the United States (5 patients), France (1 patient), and Germany (1 patient); the vedolizumab exposure by country was approximately 61,488 PY, 5524 PY, and 14,222 PY, respectively. Further details of the tuberculosis case reports received are described in the supplementary material (see case narratives, Supplemental Digital Content 2 and 3).\\nIn the context of approximately 114,071 PY of vedolizumab post-marketing exposure, 29 patients with a history of or concurrent HBV or HCV infection were identified in the Global Safety Database. Fourteen patients had a medical history of hepatitis B (of these, 3 were confirmed as having chronic HBV infection; the infection status of the other 11 patients was unknown), and 15 patients had a medical history of hepatitis C. Of the 29 patients, 10 patients were diagnosed with ulcerative colitis, 17 patients with Crohn’s disease, and the indication was not specified for 2 patients. Patient age ranged from 24 to 75 years, and 18 patients were male.\\nMost patients (16 of 29; 55.2%) had prior or concomitant exposure to TNF antagonists. Patients were from Canada (18 patients), the United States (6 patients), Israel (2 patients), and Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland (1 patient each). Total vedolizumab exposure by country was approximately 5882 PY, 61,488 PY, 1510 PY, 2135 PY, 1852 PY, and 1538 PY, respectively.\\nA total of 109 adverse events (Table, Supplemental Digital Content 4) were reported in these 29 patients, most of which were nonserious (25 serious nonfatal events and 84 nonserious events). The most frequently reported event was increased blood pressure (7 patients with transient increased blood pressure associated with their infusion visit), followed by nausea (4 patients). Vedolizumab treatment was continued in 22 of 27 patients with available data (treatment continuation/discontinuation not reported in 2 patients). No trends were observed in the reported adverse events, which reflected the general vedolizumab safety profile in patients without viral hepatitis.\\nLiver-related events were reported in 2 patients. A hepatic neoplasm (nodule in liver found on magnetic resonance imaging) was reported in a 61-year-old patient with Crohn’s disease and a history of hepatitis C, blood transfusion, and 4 bowel resections; this event was assessed by the physician as serious (outcome not reported). A hepatic mass (hypodense lesion in the right hepatic lobe) was reported in a 70-year-old patient with Crohn’s disease and a history of hepatitis C, skin cancer, cholecystectomy, removal of bladder tumor, and right radical orchiectomy. This event was assessed by the physician as not serious (outcome also not reported).\\nIn pooled data from phase 3 clinical trials of vedolizumab for the treatment of ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease, we found that the rate of opportunistic infections was low, with an incidence of 0.7 per 100 PY (Table 1). The rate of opportunistic infections in the LTS study of vedolizumab was also relatively low, with an incidence of 1.0 per 100 PY. These data (based on a data cut of May 2015) extend the findings reported by Colombel et al. (2017), which used an earlier data cut (June 2013); this correlation suggests that the rates were stable over the study period. The most commonly reported infections were C. difficile or CMV infections and esophageal candidiasis; however, few of these infections led to the discontinuation of vedolizumab. In the post-marketing setting, 217 opportunistic infections were reported in 210 patients (99 of whom had prior exposure to TNF antagonists), including 2 opportunistic infections that resulted in death. Tuberculosis was reported in 5 (0.1%) patients in clinical trials and 7 patients in the post-marketing setting. We also identified 29 patients in the vedolizumab Global Safety Database with a history of or concurrent HBV/HCV infection; however, none reported viral reactivation after vedolizumab treatment.\\nPatients with IBD are at an increased risk of developing C. difficile infection; in one study by Nguyen et al. (2008), the prevalence of C. difficile in patients with ulcerative colitis was 37.3/1000, compared with 10.9/1000 in patients with Crohn’s disease and 4.5/1000 in general medical patients. The frequency of opportunistic infections such as C. difficile infections in patients with IBD is further increased with the use of immunosuppressive therapies, including TNF antagonists. Patients with IBD who develop C. difficile infections have higher colectomy and mortality rates. The occurrence and severity of C. difficile infections in patients with IBD may in part relate to host factors such as immune response and changes in the gut microbiota. A recent case-control study found that the use of a TNF antagonist (not controlling for concomitant medications that included azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine) was associated with an increased risk of opportunistic infection (odds ratio 4.4; 95% CI 1.1–17.0; P = 0.03), which may be due to systemic immunosuppression by TNF antagonists. In addition, the risk of an opportunistic infection was found to be increased by the use of steroids in combination with other immunosuppressive agents.\\nThe results of the present analysis demonstrate that the majority of patients treated with vedolizumab in both clinical trial and post-marketing settings did not experience a serious opportunistic infection, and most patients continued vedolizumab treatment. Comparison between vedolizumab treatment and TNF antagonist therapy was not possible using these data, because the studies were not designed for such an analysis. A history of multiple drug therapies in both the clinical trial and post-marketing settings must be considered when interpreting these results. In the current analysis, all post-marketing opportunistic infections reported from Canada originated from a large, ongoing patient support program and were therefore solicited (as opposed to being spontaneous reports).\\nA previous analysis of safety data from 6 clinical trials, including 2830 patients with IBD and covering 4811 PY of vedolizumab exposure, showed no increased risk of serious infections or opportunistic infections with vedolizumab compared with placebo. Overall, serious clostridial infections, sepsis, and tuberculosis were reported in ≤0.6% of patients (0.3, 0.2, and 0.1 per 100 PY, respectively). The current analysis is based on a larger clinical trial data set—including 3677 patients, covering 6488 PY of vedolizumab exposure and approximately 114,071 PY of post-marketing data—and is consistent with the previous safety data analysis.\\nProgressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy is a disabling and potentially fatal neurologic syndrome that can occur in the presence of severe immunosuppression. This disease is an uncommon adverse effect of treatment with natalizumab, an α4 integrin antagonist with a mechanism of action that decreases immune surveillance within the central nervous system, thereby increasing the risk of developing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. Vedolizumab selectively targets the α4β7 integrin expressed on gut-homing lymphocytes, with non-gut-homing T lymphocytes remaining unaffected. No cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy were reported in the GEMINI trials or in any other reports of vedolizumab use to date.\\nTNF antagonists and recent hospitalization appear to be risk factors for reactivation of latent tuberculosis in patients with IBD. A meta-analysis of data from randomized clinical trials found that treatment with TNF antagonists in patients with IBD more than doubled the risk of tuberculosis (relative risk 2.5; 95% CI 0.6–10.2). To minimize the risk of reactivation of latent tuberculosis, clinical practice guidelines recommend screening patients for tuberculosis before initiation of TNF antagonist therapy. However, recent studies have highlighted an increased risk of tuberculosis even among patients with a negative screening test prior to the initiation of TNF antagonists. It has been shown that screening for latent tuberculosis while patients are already on immunosuppressive therapies may lead to a lower rate of positivity for the interferon-gamma release assay.\\nTuberculosis was reported in 5 patients participating in vedolizumab clinical trials and 7 patients in the post-marketing setting (Tables 3 and 4). In the clinical trials, 3 of 5 adverse events were reported from countries with a high incidence of tuberculosis in the general population. The incidence of tuberculosis in patients with IBD treated with vedolizumab in clinical trials was similar to incidence rates in their respective countries of origin (Table 3), with over one-half of patients having had prior exposure to TNF antagonists. However, the sample size is too small to draw a firm conclusion, particularly because it is difficult to reliably assess the incidence or risk of uncommon adverse events such as tuberculosis from a relatively small study population or based on voluntary reports. The geographic distribution of tuberculosis reports in the Global Safety Database reflects a greater exposure to vedolizumab in the United States, France, and Germany (ie, the countries where vedolizumab has been available since 2014). This is compared with fewer tuberculosis reports in countries where vedolizumab is not yet approved or has only recently become available but where there is a higher background prevalence of tuberculosis.\\nOverall, the current analysis of data from clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance did not suggest an increased risk of tuberculosis with vedolizumab use. In the post-marketing setting, patients with tuberculosis were able to restart vedolizumab therapy after treatment of their tuberculosis (described in Supplemental Digital Content 3).\\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study that addresses the risk of reactivation of HBV or HCV infection with vedolizumab therapy. A total of 29 patients receiving vedolizumab were identified in the Global Safety Database as having had a history of or concurrent HBV or HCV infection. More than one-half of all patients reported prior or concomitant therapy with a TNF antagonist. Of a total of 109 adverse events, most (77%) were nonserious. The most frequently reported adverse events included increased blood pressure and nausea, reflecting the general safety profile observed in patients without HBV/HCV receiving vedolizumab. There was no evidence of viral hepatitis reactivation in these case reports. One liver-related event (a hepatic neoplasm) was assessed as serious by the investigator. Among patients with available data, 81% continued vedolizumab treatment despite reporting adverse events.\\nCertain limitations should be considered when interpreting the LTS clinical trial data, such as the lack of corresponding long-term data for patients on placebo or on an active comparator, such as TNF antagonists, which would have allowed a direct comparison. However, the study included a heterogeneous patient population with some patients who received vedolizumab de novo, some who had completed a previous clinical trial of vedolizumab, and others who had experienced no response to vedolizumab or disease worsening in previous trials. Therefore, the population reflects the real-life situation and may be more representative of patients in clinical practice than of those who participated in the randomized, controlled trials.\\nLimitations of post-marketing data include the voluntary nature of reporting, incomplete details of the event (eg, the temporal relationship between drug administration and event), incomplete comorbidity and comedication data, and an inconsistent level of detail of patients’ past medical histories. Serious events are more likely to be reported than less serious ones. A further potential reporting bias that also needs to be considered is that adverse event reports may be more likely to be submitted when solicited through patient support programs. Nonetheless, the data presented here represent the first post-marketing dataset that highlights the long-term safety of vedolizumab in the real-world setting without the constraints and stringent patient selection of clinical trials.\\nIn conclusion, clinical trial and post-marketing data in patients with IBD receiving vedolizumab showed that the rate of serious opportunistic infection was low, and most patients were able to continue vedolizumab treatment. The frequency of tuberculosis was also low, and there was no evidence of viral reactivation in patients with a history of HBV or HCV infection. The LTS study, ongoing observational studies, and real-world data will be important to provide further insights into the frequency of opportunistic infections and tuberculosis in patients treated with vedolizumab. Such data will help inform treatment decisions in clinical practice.\\nSupplementary data are available at Inflammatory Bowel Diseases online.\\nSupported by Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd.

       "    'fulltext': 'Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a disabling and potentially fatal neurological syndrome caused by the John Cunningham virus (JCV) that can occur in the setting of severe immunosuppression. In addition to infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the use of immunomodulatory therapies—including the α4 integrin antagonist natalizumab—has been associated with the development of PML. Although PML in patients treated with natalizumab is a relatively rare event, the risk increases with duration of use of >2 years, prior use of immunosuppressants, and JCV seropositivity. Currently available data suggest that natalizumab-associated PML is associated with a better survival rate compared with PML in other populations, such as in patients with HIV infection (before the availability of highly active antiretroviral therapy) and in transplant recipients. Nonetheless, the natalizumab-associated PML mortality rate is approximately 24%, and surviving patients are frequently left with disability.\\nVedolizumab (Entyvio; Takeda Pharmaceuticals, Deerfield, IL, USA) is licensed to treat adults with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease who have had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonist or immunomodulator, or had an inadequate response with, were intolerant to, or demonstrated dependence on corticosteroids.\\nAs a humanized monoclonal antibody that antagonizes α4β7 integrin, vedolizumab has some similarity in its mechanism of action to that of natalizumab. Natalizumab is a humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody that inhibits the α4 subunit of the α4β1 integrin, preventing it from binding to vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1). This results in decreased immune surveillance within the central nervous system (CNS), thus increasing the risk of PML development. However, vedolizumab does not inhibit binding at VCAM-1, and instead selectively targets the α4β7 integrin expressed on gut-homing lymphocytes, with non-gut-homing T lymphocytes remaining unaffected.\\nAt the time this paper was submitted for publication, there have been no cases of PML reported in association with vedolizumab use. This, combined with the gastrointestinal selective mechanism of action of vedolizumab, supports the hypothesis that this agent does not predispose to the development of PML. However, given the rarity of the condition, the knowledge that the PML risk increases with duration of natalizumab use of >2 years, and the fact that vedolizumab is a relatively novel therapy (US and European approval were obtained in 2014), we cannot yet have absolute confidence in this supposition. Monitoring for new or worsening neurologic signs or symptoms is therefore recommended with vedolizumab treatment, and continued monitoring has been ongoing since clinical development.\\nGreater certainty regarding the risk of PML with vedolizumab treatment would be of great benefit to patients and clinicians. Hence, our aim here is to use the totality of the available randomized controlled trial (RCT) and observational data to explore how confident we can be that vedolizumab does not predispose to the development of PML.\\nThe estimated vedolizumab cumulative exposure to May 19, 2016, was calculated based on data from both the clinical trial program (Table; Supplemental Digital Content 1, which lists the clinical studies included in the risk modeling analyses) and postmarketing sales (a total of >8 years in the clinical trial program and up to 2 years’ postmarketing exposure). For clinical trial data, exposure was calculated as the sum of individual exposure periods for each clinical trial patient. For postmarketing data, it was assumed that each patient was treated with vedolizumab 300 mg (1 vial) every 8 weeks. Exposure was calculated based on sales, and to estimate duration of use, we assumed a steady attrition rate between 10% and 30% per year (based on 7-year long-term observational study data) up to the data cutoff point.\\nData on adverse events (AEs) up to May 19, 2016, were obtained from the Takeda Global Safety Database, which contains vedolizumab data from clinical trials and postmarketing reporting, held in accordance with routine pharmacovigilance practices. Vedolizumab AE data were obtained from spontaneous reports submitted to Takeda directly from consumers, manufacturers, healthcare professionals, and regulatory authorities; from Takeda monitoring of the scientific and medical literature; and from solicited reports from clinical trials and patient support and market research programs.\\nFrom these data (patient-years [PY] of exposure and number of cases of PML), we estimated the risk of PML as cases per 100,000 PY of exposure; 95% confidence intervals (CIs) around this were calculated assuming a Poisson distribution (the probability of observing at least k events was also based on the assumption that events follow a Poisson distribution). The risk estimates were adjusted to account for the increased risk of PML after 2 years of therapy.\\nPatients enrolled in clinical trials, postauthorization safety studies, patient support, and market research programs provided informed consent for participation in the studies, including the collection of AE data. Institutional Review Board review and approvals were obtained for these studies.\\nThe total number of expected cases of vedolizumab-associated PML was estimated assuming that vedolizumab use conferred a risk equivalent to that associated with natalizumab use. Previously published rates of PML in natalizumab users were utilized, as described in the US prescribing information and published data (0.56/1000 to 13/1000 over 6 years’ exposure).\\nPatients were grouped according to level of exposure to vedolizumab and risk factors (prior immunosuppressant use [same risk assumed for all immunosuppressants including azathioprine, methotrexate, and TNF antagonists] and anti-JCV antibody-positive status) to mirror patient stratification described in the natalizumab US prescribing information. To do this, we estimated the levels of prior immunosuppressant use and anti-JCV antibody-positive status. Based on vedolizumab clinical trial data, it was assumed that approximately 80% of patients had prior immunosuppressive use. Because JCV antibody testing was not required by the vedolizumab clinical trial protocols, an estimate was made based on published rates (anti-JCV antibody-positivity was assumed in approximately 50% of patients). Vedolizumab patient counts in each stratum were multiplied by the corresponding risk estimate for natalizumab and summed to obtain the total number of expected cases; the 95% CI estimate (calculated using StatXact 9 software) was based on the normal approximation to the Poisson distribution.\\nThe expected occurrence of PML in patients receiving vedolizumab was also calculated, assuming the same PML incidence rate (per 100,000 PY) as in the general population and in populations in which the risk of PML is known to be elevated. These groups include patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), HIV-free systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients, HIV-free non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) patients, HIV-free autoimmune vasculitis patients, HIV-free chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients, bone marrow transplant recipients, patients with HIV, heart and/or lung transplant recipients, and HIV-free rituximab-exposed NHL patients. The expected number of PML cases and associated 95% CIs for vedolizumab, if the risk were equivalent to each reference population, were calculated by multiplying the population incidence rate (per 100,000 PY) and 95% CI by the total PY of exposure to vedolizumab. Because data for these populations were not reported in strata of immunosuppression use or JCV positivity, it was not possible to standardize these estimates.\\nThe probability of a future PML case in vedolizumab-treated patients was estimated, assuming the same risk as in 3 reference populations: the general population, patients with RA, and patients with SLE (without HIV). The current total number of PY of vedolizumab exposure was estimated as specified above (in the Patients and Data Collection section), and the likely future exposure to vedolizumab from 2016 to 2034 was estimated based on sales projections. The probabilities of a case arising for each year were estimated using the Poisson approximation to the binomial distribution (frequentist approach), using the expected cumulative PY by that year as the number of trials and the PML probability in the reference population as the event probability. The probabilities of ≥2 and ≥3 future PML cases in vedolizumab-treated patients were similarly estimated. A sensitivity analysis using a Bayesian approach was also conducted for the general population-based analysis. A conjugate beta distribution was assumed for the prior distribution of the PML probability, with the following 2 shape parameters: α = 1 + number of PML events in current trials (ie, 0), and β = the current total PY + the reciprocal of the estimated PML probability of the general population. The predictive probability of ≥1 PML future occurrence for each year was estimated by a beta-binomial distribution based on number of trials equal to the forecasted cumulative PY by that year.\\nUp to May 19, 2016, the cumulative vedolizumab exposure was approximately 54,619 PY, which comprised 7641 PY (3821 patients) from clinical trials and an estimated 46,978 PY from postmarketing use (Table 1). To date, no cases of PML have been observed in patients treated with vedolizumab. The CI calculated around the rate of 0 cases of PML per 100,000 PY of exposure was 0–6.75 cases of PML per 100,000 PY of exposure.\\nBased on cumulative exposure to vedolizumab, 30.2 cases of PML (95% CI, 19.4–40.9) would be expected if vedolizumab exposure conferred the same risk as that of natalizumab (Table 2). Similarly, given cumulative vedolizumab exposure of approximately 54,619 PY, assuming an equivalent risk to the different reference populations, the number of expected PML cases for vedolizumab-treated patients is lowest in the general population (0.2; 95% CI, 0.05–0.3) and patients with RA (0.6; 95% CI, 0.2–1.4). Higher numbers would be expected in other disease populations, including bone marrow transplant recipients (19.3; 95% CI, 0.5–107.8) and heart and/or lung transplant recipients (67.7; 95% CI, 13.7–197.2), with the highest number anticipated in HIV-free rituximab-exposed NHL patients (131.1; 95% CI, 54.6–305.9) (Table 3).\\nIf the risk of developing PML with vedolizumab were the same as in the general population, the estimated probability of observing the first PML case in vedolizumab-treated patients would be approximately 50% by 2018 and 90% by 2022 (Fig. 1A). An estimated ≥2 or ≥3 cases will occur by 2021 (Fig. 1B) and 2023 (Fig. 1C), respectively, with a >50% probability.\\nAssuming the risk of PML with vedolizumab were identical to that in patients with RA or HIV-free SLE, the first PML case would be likely to occur earlier than predicted for the general population (>90% probability of first case by 2019 and 2017, respectively) (Fig. 1A). Assuming the risk is the same as in RA, ≥2 or ≥3 cases would occur with a >90% probability by 2020 and 2021, respectively, and ≥2 or ≥3 cases would occur with a >90% probability by 2018 and 2019, respectively, assuming an identical risk to that in patients with HIV-free SLE (Fig. 1B and C).\\nIn the sensitivity analysis, using the Bayesian approach and historical data of the general population as prior information, we estimate that the probability of observing the first PML case in vedolizumab users will occur with 50% probability during 2019, over a year later than in the estimate based on the frequentist approach (Supplemental Digital Content 2).\\nIn this analysis, we provide evidence supporting the hypothesized lower risk of PML in users of vedolizumab versus those of natalizumab. We also estimate the numbers of PML cases that might be expected if vedolizumab users had risk levels equivalent to those of a variety of other population groups. Of these, the risk of PML in the general population or in patients with RA, HIV-free SLE, HIV-free NHL, or autoimmune vasculitis would be consistent with the observed absence of PML cases to date. The current data are, however, not consistent with vedolizumab carrying the elevated risk of PML seen in HIV infection, heart/lung transplantation, or rituximab use. Because there have been no cases of PML observed to date, it is difficult to precisely estimate the true level of risk, although our current analysis suggests that it is not likely to be above 6.75 cases per 100,000 PY. Assuming an identical risk to that in the general population, the first PML case with vedolizumab treatment was estimated to occur with a 50% probability in 2019 and 2018, using Bayesian and frequentist approaches, respectively.\\nThe analysis we present here has methodological challenges. Because we do not have access to the health records of the vast majority of patients receiving vedolizumab, we have not reviewed individual patients’ medical records to confirm an absence of PML. However, we have gone to great lengths to attempt to ascertain cases through analysis of available RCT and observational data. Bearing in mind the serious nature of PML, it would be expected that all cases occurring in patients receiving vedolizumab in routine clinical practice would be reported. Additionally, direct information regarding prior immunosuppressant use or the presence of JCV in those receiving vedolizumab outside clinical trials is not available. However, there is no reason to believe that those receiving vedolizumab in the postmarketing setting would be less likely to have used immunosuppressants than those in the RCTs. Rather we think it unlikely that many prescribers will yet be using a “top-down” approach starting initial therapy with vedolizumab, or be using it as rescue therapy in acute flares. Immunosuppressant use might well therefore be almost universal in vedolizumab users, in which case the assumption we have made will be highly conservative (we will have underestimated the likely level of PML if risks were equivalent to those in natalizumab).\\nA further set of challenges with this analysis relates to the available data on population levels of PML. Ideally, we would standardize for age, sex, and immunosuppressant use for all populations; however, the rarity of the condition means that the population data required to achieve this are unavailable. Our estimates, with the exception of that relating to natalizumab, therefore do not take into account any of these confounding factors.\\nWhen considering the limitations of this analysis, however, it is important to consider the alternatives. It could be argued that absolute proof that there is no risk could be demonstrated only through a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, with PML development as the primary outcome measure and with sufficient power to demonstrate equivalence between vedolizumab-treated patients and those receiving placebo. Such a trial would arguably be unethical and would require an unfeasibly large patient population (for example, in the context of 0 events and based on the statistical “rule of 3”, a sample size of 300,000 PY [for each of the vedolizumab and placebo cohorts] would be required to rule out a risk of >1 event per 100,000 PY with 95% confidence). Therefore, targeted observational research such as the current analysis is likely to be the best available option in this scenario. Due to uncertainty in the current estimate of the true risk of PML associated with vedolizumab, we have provided estimates of the probability of observing future PML cases under various risk scenarios.\\nDespite the limitations of the available data, it is nonetheless useful to consider the conclusions that can confidently be made. To begin with, it is clear that if the risk of PML were the same as with natalizumab, 30 cases of PML would have been observed by May 19, 2016, in patients treated with vedolizumab, with a 95% CI lower bound of 19 cases. Therefore, we can reasonably conclude that there is a much lower risk of PML with vedolizumab than with natalizumab. Such a conclusion is not surprising because natalizumab is a humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody that inhibits the α4 subunit of the α4β1 integrin, preventing it from binding to VCAM-1. By preventing α4β1 binding to VCAM-1 on endothelial cells, extravasation of immune inflammatory cells into the brain is prevented, leading to decreased immune surveillance in the CNS that is hypothesized to predispose to development of PML with natalizumab use. By contrast, vedolizumab is the first available agent that selectively targets the α4β7 integrin heterodimer, specifically preventing extravasation of immune inflammatory cells into the gut, with no evidence of an impact on immune surveillance in the CNS. We can also conclude that, if the PML risk does not increase with long-term vedolizumab use, it is unlikely that the true level of risk is above 6.75 cases per 100,000 PY given current exposure estimates.\\nTo put this into context, such a risk should be compared not only with the known risk of PML associated with other treatments (as has been done here), but also with the uncertainty regarding other medications such as corticosteroids and thioguanines, which have both been associated with the development of this condition. A 2009 study of nationwide US inpatient sample data showed that 20% of cases of PML in rheumatic diseases were associated with the use of only very mild immunosuppression with an antimalarial or low-dose prednisolone, and analysis of French pharmacovigilance reports shows that PML has significantly elevated reported odds ratios (in excess of 4) for both prednisolone and azathioprine. Finally, we should consider what other risks patients might run with alternative therapies. In many cases, the alternatives to vedolizumab will be either immunosuppression or surgery. Neither of these is risk-free, with a colectomy being associated with mortality of about 1% and azathioprine with a cumulative lymphoma risk of approximately 0.4–4.0% over 10 years (depending on age).\\nIn conclusion, our calculations have shown that the risk of PML with vedolizumab is likely to be significantly lower than that with natalizumab. With no cases having been reported to date, the eventual level of risk cannot be precisely estimated; however, these analyses indicate that the risk is small, and unlikely to be above 6.75 cases per 100,000 PY. Confirmation as to whether the risk is appreciably greater than in the background population remains to be seen as further data are accrued from continued postmarketing surveillance.\\nSupplementary data are available at Inflammatory Bowel Diseases online.\\nConflicts of interest: Timothy Card has no active conflicts of interest to declare.

       "    'fulltext': 'The inflammatory bowel diseases ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD) are chronic diseases that are characterized by exacerbated inflammatory cell infiltrate into gut mucosal tissue. Currently available treatment options for patients with UC or CD include glucocorticosteroids, immunosuppressants (i.e., azathioprine, mercaptopurine, or methotrexate), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) antagonists, and, most recently, integrin antagonists. Vedolizumab (previous versions were known as LDP-02, MLN-02, and MLN0002) is a recombinant monoclonal antibody that binds specifically to the α4β7 integrin, thereby modulating the trafficking of memory T\\xa0cells into inflamed gut mucosal tissue. Vedolizumab is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active UC or CD and is administered as a 300\\xa0mg intravenous (IV) infusion over approximately 30\\xa0min at 0, 2, and 6\\xa0weeks and every 8\\xa0weeks thereafter. The European prescribing information suggests that some patients with UC or CD who have experienced a decrease in their response to vedolizumab may benefit from an increase in dosing frequency to every 4\\xa0weeks. The clinical profile of vedolizumab is consistent with its binding specificity, with evidence of therapeutic benefit in patients with UC or CD and a lack of systemic immunosuppression. The aim of this article is to review the clinical pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, exposure–efficacy relationships, and immunogenicity of vedolizumab.\\nVedolizumab is a recombinant humanized immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Vedolizumab was generated by fusing the binding domains from the mouse anti-human α4β7 monoclonal antibody Act-1 to a conventional human IgG1 scaffold. In addition, two mutations were introduced into the Fc region of vedolizumab, which eliminated some Fc-mediated functions such as cytotoxicity. Vedolizumab is composed of two light chains of the kappa subclass and two heavy chains linked by two disulfide bridges, forming a Y-structure that is typical of immunoglobulins. The molecular weight of vedolizumab is approximately 147\\xa0kDa.\\nA significant body of biochemical, preclinical, and clinical evidence supports the gut-selective anti-inflammatory mechanism of action of vedolizumab, which has been reviewed in detail elsewhere. Vedolizumab binds specifically to the α4β7 integrin heterodimer, but not to the functionally distinct α4β1 or αEβ7 integrin heterodimers, thereby inhibiting the binding of α4β7-expressing cells to mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 (MAdCAM-1) and fibronectin, but not to vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1). This inhibitory effect is reversible on removal of vedolizumab; binding of peripheral blood lymphocytes to MAdCAM-1 was partially restored within 24\\xa0h and fully restored after 4\\xa0days. Although moderately expressed on several other types of leukocytes, such as B\\xa0cells, eosinophils, and natural killer cells, the α4β7 integrin is preferentially expressed on a subset of memory CD4+ T\\xa0cells and mediates binding of these cells to MAdCAM-1 expressed on endothelial cells. The α4β7–MAdCAM-1 interaction is required for lymphocyte trafficking to the gut, and it is key to the pathology of inflammatory bowel diseases. By binding to the α4β7 integrin, vedolizumab selectively inhibits adhesion of memory T\\xa0cells to MAdCAM-1 and the migration of these cells to the site of gut inflammation. Vedolizumab does not activate lymphocytes, affect cytokine production by differentiated T\\xa0cells, or lyse target cells by complement-dependent cytotoxicity or antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity.\\nBlockade of the α4β7 integrin by vedolizumab has been shown to elicit gut-selective anti-inflammatory effects in primates. The gut selectivity of vedolizumab has also been confirmed in clinical studies. In a vaccination study in healthy volunteers, vedolizumab attenuated the response to an enteral antigen challenge (oral cholera vaccine) but did not affect the response to a parenteral antigen challenge (intramuscular hepatitis\\xa0B vaccine). In contrast to natalizumab, vedolizumab had no effect on T\\xa0cell trafficking to the central nervous system in preclinical and clinical studies, providing further evidence of its gut selectivity.\\nThe pharmacokinetic properties of vedolizumab were evaluated in single-dose studies in healthy volunteers and in multiple-dose studies in patients with UC or CD. In these studies, vedolizumab serum concentrations were measured using a validated sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), as previously described. The lower limit of quantification of this assay was 1.25\\xa0ng/mL (0.125\\xa0µg/mL in undiluted serum). Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined using standard non-compartmental methods.\\nA population pharmacokinetic analysis was also performed to assess the effects of patient demographics and other covariates on the pharmacokinetics of vedolizumab in patients with UC or CD using extensively collected data from phase\\xa0I and II studies and sparsely collected data from the phase\\xa0III GEMINI studies. A repeated-measures analysis was conducted using a non-linear mixed effects modeling (NONMEM) approach.\\nVedolizumab was administered as a single IV infusion to healthy volunteers on a body weight-adjusted basis over the dose range of 0.2–10.0\\xa0mg/kg in a phase\\xa0I study. After reaching peak concentrations, vedolizumab serum concentrations declined in a generally linear fashion until concentrations reached approximately 10\\xa0µg/mL (Fig.\\xa01). Thereafter, concentrations appeared to decline in a non-linear fashion. Vedolizumab maximum observed serum concentration (C max) was dose proportional over the dose range tested (Table\\xa01). Greater than dose-proportional increases in the vedolizumab area under the serum concentration–time curve (AUC) from time zero to infinity (AUC0−∞) and dose-dependent decreases in clearance (CL) and increases in terminal elimination half-life (t ½ β) were observed from 0.2 to 2.0\\xa0mg/kg (Table\\xa01). At dose levels >2.0\\xa0mg/kg, the increases in AUC0−∞ were dose proportional and CL and t ½ did not change. These data suggest that a rapid elimination process becomes saturated as the vedolizumab dose increases, and slower linear elimination processes likely account for a large fraction of vedolizumab CL at higher concentrations.  \\nVedolizumab was also administered as a single IV infusion to healthy volunteers on a fixed-dose basis over the dose range of 180–750\\xa0mg. Comparison of the data across these studies revealed that vedolizumab exposure increased in a dose-proportional manner at doses >180\\xa0mg (Table\\xa02). The apparent linear pharmacokinetics at doses >180\\xa0mg (equivalent to 2.4\\xa0mg/kg in a 75\\xa0kg individual) is consistent with the data from the healthy volunteer study with body weight-adjusted (mg/kg) dosing. \\nThe pharmacokinetics of vedolizumab following repeat IV infusions were evaluated in patients with UC or CD over the dose range of 0.5–10\\xa0mg/kg in phase\\xa0II studies. In patients with UC, vedolizumab concentrations increased with increasing dose over the range of 2–10\\xa0mg/kg, after an IV infusion on days 1, 15, 29, and 85. After the last dose on day\\xa085, vedolizumab concentrations decreased in an approximately bi-exponential fashion. The pharmacokinetics of vedolizumab were dose proportional over the 2–10\\xa0mg/kg dose range based on C max and AUC during the dosing interval (AUCτ) after dosing on days 1 and 85 (Table\\xa03). \\nThe pharmacokinetics of vedolizumab in patients with UC or CD were also assessed in the phase\\xa0III GEMINI studies using a sparse (population-based) sampling scheme. During GEMINI\\xa01 and GEMINI\\xa02, patients received a 300\\xa0mg IV infusion of vedolizumab at weeks 0, and 2, (induction phase) and every 4 or 8\\xa0weeks thereafter\\xa0starting at week 6 (maintenance phase). During GEMINI\\xa03, patients received a 300\\xa0mg IV infusion of vedolizumab at weeks 0, 2, and 6 (induction only). At week\\xa06, mean vedolizumab trough serum concentrations were similar in patients with UC in GEMINI\\xa01 and in patients with CD in GEMINI\\xa02 and GEMINI\\xa03 (Table\\xa04). During the maintenance phases of both GEMINI\\xa01 and GEMINI\\xa02, the last vedolizumab trough concentration was measured at week\\xa046 and was used to represent the end-of-treatment, steady-state trough concentration. At week\\xa046, the mean vedolizumab trough concentration was higher in patients who received vedolizumab every 4\\xa0weeks than in patients who received vedolizumab every 8\\xa0weeks in both studies (Table\\xa04). \\nThe median trough serum concentration–time profile for each treatment regimen during the maintenance phase of GEMINI\\xa01 and GEMINI\\xa02 has been previously reported. Patients who received two doses of vedolizumab during induction and placebo during maintenance had measurable vedolizumab trough concentrations in serum until week\\xa038.\\nFrom the population pharmacokinetic analysis, the pharmacokinetics of vedolizumab were best described by a two-compartment model with zero-order input and parallel linear and non-linear elimination, similar to that described for other therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. The non-linear elimination process was modeled using a Michaelis–Menten equation. The overall inter-individual variability was moderate to large. The effects of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on the pharmacokinetics of vedolizumab were investigated using a full covariate modeling approach. Inferences about the clinical relevance of parameters were based on the resulting parameter estimates and measures of estimation precision [Bayesian 95% credible intervals (CDIs)] from the final model. Covariate effect sizes on linear CL (CLL) of less than ±25% from the typical population value, when evaluated over a representative range of covariate values, were not considered clinically relevant changes. Pharmacokinetic parameter estimates derived from the model are described in Sects. 4.4–4.6, as are the effects of covariates on vedolizumab CLL.\\nThe vedolizumab volume of distribution at steady state (V ss) after a single IV infusion of 300\\xa0mg in healthy volunteers was estimated to be 4.49\\xa0L [percent coefficient of variation (%CV) 14.3%] (Table\\xa02). From the final population pharmacokinetic model, vedolizumab V ss was estimated to be 4.84\\xa0L for both patients with UC and patients with CD [volume of distribution in the central compartment (V c)\\xa0=\\xa03.19\\xa0L plus volume of distribution in the peripheral compartment (V p)\\xa0=\\xa01.65\\xa0L]. The V ss values estimated for vedolizumab are approximately equal to the volume of plasma in humans and are generally similar to those reported for other therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. After a single IV infusion of vedolizumab 450\\xa0mg in healthy volunteers, vedolizumab was not detected in the cerebrospinal fluid, suggesting that vedolizumab does not penetrate the blood–brain barrier.\\nBecause of their large molecular size, therapeutic monoclonal antibodies are not directly excreted in urine; rather they are degraded to peptides and amino acids that are either reused by the body or excreted by the kidneys. Several mechanisms are reportedly involved in the elimination of monoclonal antibodies, including proteolytic degradation by the liver or reticuloendothelial system, target-mediated elimination, and non-specific endocytosis. Vedolizumab undergoes a rapid, saturable, non-linear, target-mediated elimination process at low concentrations and a slower, linear, non-specific elimination process at higher concentrations. From the final population pharmacokinetic model, the t ½ of vedolizumab was estimated to be 25.5\\xa0days, which only accounts for elimination through the linear process. Estimates of t ½ obtained from non-compartmental analyses in the phase I and phase II studies account for elimination through both linear and non-linear processes (Tables\\xa01, 2) and, therefore, are slightly lower than the estimate obtained from population pharmacokinetic modeling. Population estimates of CLL were 0.159\\xa0L/day for patients with UC and 0.155\\xa0L/day for patients with CD. Non-linear elimination was described by a maximum elimination rate (V max) of 0.265 mg/day and concentration at half V max (K m) of 0.964\\xa0µg/mL. The relationship between non-linear, linear, and total CL values across a range of vedolizumab concentrations is depicted in Fig.\\xa02. At therapeutic concentrations, as indicated by trough concentration at steady state from dosing every 8\\xa0weeks (>10\\xa0μg/mL), vedolizumab is eliminated primarily through the linear pathway. \\nThe population pharmacokinetic analysis investigated population differences in vedolizumab CLL and V c for patients with UC or CD. Population estimates of CLL were similar for patients with UC and for patients with CD, as described in Sect. 4.5. The results also indicated that V c did not appreciably differ between the two diseases (point estimate of 1.01 and 95% CDI of 0.989–1.03).\\nSex differences in pharmacokinetics have been reported for other therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. In general, volume of distribution and/or CL of monoclonal antibodies increase with body size and, thus, are higher in men than in women. No clinical study to date has directly assessed the effect of sex on vedolizumab pharmacokinetics. From the population pharmacokinetic model, sex was determined not to be a clinically relevant covariate after adjusting for other predictors of vedolizumab CLL; the estimates of CLL and V c were only approximately 10 and 6% lower, respectively in female patients than male patients.\\nNo dedicated clinical study has assessed the effect of age on the pharmacokinetics of vedolizumab. However, population pharmacokinetic modeling indicated that age had no clinically relevant effect on vedolizumab CLL within the age range tested (18–78\\xa0years) (point estimate of −0.0346 and 95% CDI of −0.0788 to 0.01).\\nThe impact of race on vedolizumab pharmacokinetics has not been directly evaluated in a clinical study or by population pharmacokinetic modeling. From a cross-study comparison, the pharmacokinetic parameters observed in Japanese patients with UC after a 150 or 300\\xa0mg IV infusion of vedolizumab were similar to those in Western (non-Hispanic White) patients with UC after a 2–10\\xa0mg/kg dose (~150–750\\xa0mg).\\nBody weight has often been reported to be a predictor of volume of distribution and/or CL of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, although its effect is not always considered clinically relevant. During the clinical development program, vedolizumab was administered initially on a body weight-adjusted (mg/kg) basis and subsequently on a fixed-dose basis (mg). The impact of body weight on the pharmacokinetics of vedolizumab was first assessed in a phase\\xa0I study in healthy volunteers. The results of this study revealed that weight-adjusted dosing overcompensated for exposure of vedolizumab in individuals with higher weight, suggesting that weight-adjusted dosing may have little advantage over fixed doses (unpublished data). Therefore, fixed doses of vedolizumab were used in all subsequent studies, including in the phase\\xa0III GEMINI studies.\\nThe effect of body weight on vedolizumab CLL was further assessed through population pharmacokinetic modeling. An allometric relationship was included in the model to describe the relationship between body weight and CLL. From this analysis, body weight was determined to be a statistically significant predictor of vedolizumab CLL, with a point estimate of 0.362 and a narrow 95% CDI of 0.299–0.427. Body weight did not appear to have a clinically relevant effect on CLL for individuals weighing <120\\xa0kg. However, the typical individual weighing 120\\xa0kg had a 19% probability of having a CLL value >25% higher than that of a patient weighing 70\\xa0kg (reference patient; albumin of 4.0\\xa0g/dL for both cases), an effect that is considered of potential clinical relevance.\\nThe effect of disease activity on the pharmacokinetics of vedolizumab was assessed through population modeling using the partial Mayo score and the Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score at baseline. Both covariates had no effect on vedolizumab CLL (point estimate of −0.0515 and 95% CDI of −0.14 to 0.0358 for CDAI score; point estimate of 0.0408 and 95% CDI of −0.0336 to 0.115 for partial Mayo score).\\nFor patients with UC from GEMINI\\xa01, median measured vedolizumab trough serum concentrations at week\\xa06 were lower in patients with higher endoscopic subscores at week\\xa06 (more severe disease). Patients with a endoscopic score of 3, indicating severe disease, had a median trough concentration (19.6\\xa0µg/mL) below the overall median concentration (25.6\\xa0µg/mL) at week\\xa06. A trend toward greater estimated vedolizumab CLL in patients with a higher endoscopic subscore was noted (Fig.\\xa03). These findings are consistent with those for other therapeutic monoclonal antibodies used for the treatment of UC and CD. It is possible that the apparent association between higher endoscopic subscores and faster vedolizumab CLL at week\\xa06 is not causal and could be attributed to several confounding factors, such as additional drug loss into the inflamed gastrointestinal tract (drug-losing enteropathy). The apparent relationship between vedolizumab CLL and the endoscopic subscore warrants further investigation. \\nThe effects of fecal calprotectin and C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations on vedolizumab CLL were evaluated in the population pharmacokinetic model as additional measures of disease severity. For fecal calprotectin, the estimated effect size, although statistically significant, was small and not considered to be clinically relevant (point estimate of 0.0310 and 95% CDI of 0.0252–0.0365). An exploratory post hoc analysis suggested that, after adjusting for other predictors of vedolizumab CLL, the effect of CRP on vedolizumab CLL was also not clinically relevant and accounted for <1% of the unexplained inter-individual variability in CL.\\nAlbumin has been demonstrated to be a predictor of the CL of other therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. From the population pharmacokinetic model, albumin concentration was a statistically significant predictor of vedolizumab CLL, with a point estimate of −1.18 and a narrow 95% CDI of −1.24 to −1.13. The clinical relevance of the effect of albumin on CLL was assessed. Vedolizumab CLL for the typical individual with an albumin concentration of 3.2\\xa0g/dL was approximately 30% higher than that of a patient with an albumin concentration of 4\\xa0g/dL (reference patient; body weight of 70\\xa0kg in both cases), an effect that is considered of potential clinical relevance.\\nFrom the population pharmacokinetic model, patients who had been treated with and failed prior TNF-α antagonist therapy had 4% faster CLL than patients who were naïve to TNF-α antagonist therapy (point estimate of 1.04 and 95% CDI of 1.01–1.07). Although statistically significant, this modest difference is not considered clinically relevant.\\nIn the GEMINI\\xa01 and GEMINI\\xa02 studies, the persistence of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) during treatment (measurable ADA titers at two or more consecutive visits) was associated with a substantial decrease in vedolizumab serum concentrations. In GEMINI\\xa01, among the six patients who were persistently ADA positive, three patients had vedolizumab trough concentrations at steady state (week\\xa046) that were below the limit of quantitation (BLQ; <0.125\\xa0µg/mL in undiluted serum), one patient had a trough concentration of 4.17\\xa0μg/mL, one patient had a trough concentration of 3.46\\xa0μg/mL, and one patient had a missing pharmacokinetic blood sample. In GEMINI\\xa02, among the three patients who were persistently ADA positive, two patients had vedolizumab trough concentrations at week\\xa046 that were BLQ and one patient had a missing sample.\\nFrom the population pharmacokinetic model, vedolizumab CLL was predicted to be 12% higher in patients who were ADA positive (either persistently or transiently) than in patients who were ADA negative (point estimate of 1.12 and 95% CDI of 1.05–1.2). Although statistically significant, this effect was not considered to be clinically relevant. However, the small number of ADA-positive patients in this analysis limit the interpretation of this result.\\nNo clinical studies have directly assessed the impact of vedolizumab administration on the pharmacokinetics of other drugs. Classic drug–drug interactions mediated through effects on enzyme systems such as the cytochrome P450 (CYP) system are generally not expected for therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. However, monoclonal antibodies that are cytokine modulators may modify the metabolism of drugs that are CYP enzyme substrates through their effects on the regulation pathways of CYP enzymes. Since vedolizumab is gut selective and does not modulate systemic cytokine production, the potential for CYP-mediated drug interactions with vedolizumab acting as the perpetrator is considered to be lower than that with drugs that systemically and directly affect cytokines.\\nPublished data show that small-molecule immunomodulators may affect the CL of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, possibly through an attenuating effect on immunogenicity. No clinical studies have been conducted to directly assess the effect of concomitant therapy on the pharmacokinetics of vedolizumab. However, the effect of concomitant immunomodulator (methotrexate, azathioprine, mercaptopurine) and aminosalicylate therapy on vedolizumab CLL was assessed through population pharmacokinetic modeling. The effect of each therapy was assessed individually in the model. The findings suggest that these drugs had no clinically relevant effect on vedolizumab CLL, in contrast to the apparent effect of immunomodulators on the immunogenicity of vedolizumab.\\nThe extent of α4β7 integrin binding by vedolizumab on peripheral blood memory T\\xa0cells has been evaluated in clinical studies using two flow cytometry binding interference assays. These assays used either the mouse monoclonal antibody Act-1, from which the binding domains of vedolizumab were derived, or MAdCAM-1, an endogenous ligand of α4β7 integrin. Act-1 was the only binding saturation biomarker used in early clinical studies, whereas a MAdCAM-1–murine Fc fusion (MAdCAM-1-Fc) was used in later clinical studies. Both assays rely on the same principle and have been described in detail elsewhere. In contrast to the Act-1 assay, vedolizumab-neutralizing ADAs do not interfere with the ability of the MAdCAM-1 assay to detect vedolizumab binding to the α4β7 integrin.\\nIn a single-dose phase\\xa0I study in healthy volunteers, administration of vedolizumab over the dose range of 0.2–10.0\\xa0mg/kg resulted in rapid and near complete inhibition of Act-1 and MAdCAM-1-Fc binding to α4β7 at all timepoints at which vedolizumab was measurable in serum. Once vedolizumab concentrations were no longer detectable, the inhibition of binding returned to approximately baseline levels. The duration of α4β7 receptor saturation was dose dependent.\\nSaturation of the α4β7 receptor was also evaluated following repeat IV infusions in patients with UC or CD over the dose range of 0.5–10.0\\xa0mg/kg in phase\\xa0II studies. After administration of vedolizumab 0.5 or 2.0\\xa0mg/kg on days\\xa01 and 29 to patients with UC, saturation of α4β7 receptors on >90% of peripheral blood memory T\\xa0cells was evident at both weeks 4 and 6, as determined using the Act-1 assay. In a second study in patients with UC, administration of vedolizumab 2, 6, or 10\\xa0mg/kg on days 1, 15, 29, and 85 resulted in rapid and near-maximal inhibition of MAdCAM-1-Fc binding to α4β7 at all doses and timepoints at which vedolizumab was measurable in serum (Fig.\\xa04), consistent with the single-dose healthy volunteer study. MAdCAM-1-Fc binding returned to approximately baseline levels when vedolizumab concentrations were no longer detectable. The duration of α4β7 receptor saturation was dose dependent. In patients with CD, near complete saturation of α4β7 receptors was observed after administration of vedolizumab 0.5 or 2.0\\xa0mg/kg on days 1 and 29. After the dose on day\\xa029, complete recovery of free α4β7 was evident by day 85 for the 0.5\\xa0mg/kg group and by day 180 for the 2.0\\xa0mg/kg group. \\nIn the GEMINI\\xa01 and GEMINI\\xa02 studies, α4β7 receptor saturation was measured using the MAdCAM-1-Fc assay predose at weeks 0, 6, and 52. Data from these studies were pooled with data from phase\\xa0I and II studies and analyzed using population pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic modeling. The inhibition of MAdCAM-1–α4β7 binding by vedolizumab was described by a direct-effect sigmoid maximum effect (E max) model. No formal covariate modeling or model evaluation was conducted. From this model, the vedolizumab serum concentration at half-maximum effect (EC50) was estimated to be 0.093\\xa0μg/mL, suggesting that complete receptor saturation was reached at a vedolizumab serum concentration of approximately 1\\xa0μg/mL, a concentration considered subtherapeutic. Exposure–efficacy data at week\\xa06 indicate that vedolizumab concentrations of ≤17.1\\xa0µg/mL in patients with UC in GEMINI\\xa01 and ≤16\\xa0µg/mL in patients with CD in GEMINI\\xa02 during induction were associated with clinical remission rates similar to placebo. These observations support the hypothesis that receptor saturation may be necessary but not sufficient for clinical efficacy of vedolizumab. The discrepancy between the vedolizumab concentrations required for complete receptor saturation and efficacy may be related to the fact that the MAdCAM-1-Fc assay measures α4β7 saturation on circulating T\\xa0cells (as opposed to T\\xa0cells in inflamed mucosal tissue). However, for another monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to the β7 subunit of the α4β7 and αEβ7 integrins, the drug serum concentration required for maximal saturation of β7 receptors on peripheral T\\xa0cells was sufficient for maximal occupancy of β7 receptors in the colonic mucosa, but maximal receptor occupancy did not correlate with clinical remission. The apparent lack of correlation between receptor occupancy and clinical efficacy for α4β7 and αEβ7 integrin antagonists requires further study. The MAdCAM-1 assay demonstrates α4β7 saturation from 1\\xa0µg/mL, suggesting that receptor saturation in peripheral blood lymphocytes is required for clinical efficacy but cannot achieve it alone.\\nThe exposure–efficacy relationships of vedolizumab in patients with UC from GEMINI\\xa01 have been evaluated by grouping the vedolizumab trough (predose) concentrations in quartiles and calculating the associated rates of clinical outcomes. Any confounding factors for baseline covariates were assessed using logistic regression. In these analyses, clinical remission was defined as a complete Mayo score ≤2\\xa0points with no individual subscore >1\\xa0point; clinical response was defined as a decrease in complete Mayo score ≥3\\xa0points and a ≥30% decrease from baseline, with a decrease in rectal bleeding subscore ≥1\\xa0point or an absolute rectal bleeding subscore ≤1\\xa0point; and mucosal healing was defined as a Mayo endoscopic subscore ≤1\\xa0point.\\nThe quartile analyses revealed a positive exposure–response relationship for clinical remission, clinical response, and mucosal healing for vedolizumab induction therapy in patients with UC. Vedolizumab concentrations >17.1\\xa0µg/mL at week\\xa06 were associated with higher rates of clinical remission than observed with placebo (Fig.\\xa05a). From concentration quartile\\xa01 to quartile\\xa04, the absolute rate increase was approximately 31% for clinical remission, 34% for clinical response, and 43% for mucosal healing at week 6 (Fig.\\xa05a). Consistent with these data, Mayo endoscopic scores were lower in patients with higher vedolizumab trough concentrations. \\nTo account for possible confounding of the unadjusted analyses by baseline covariates, the exposure–efficacy relationships were further explored using logistic regression. Results from the logistic regression analysis confirmed the positive exposure–efficacy relationships for clinical remission and response at week\\xa06. On average, patients with higher baseline albumin concentrations, lower baseline fecal calprotectin concentrations, and no prior TNF-α antagonist use had a higher probability of clinical remission and response whether they were receiving placebo or vedolizumab. Of these covariates, prior TNF-α antagonist use had the largest effect on the probability of efficacy; the probability of clinical remission at week\\xa06 was approximately 10% higher for patients who were naïve to TNF-α antagonists than for patients who had not responded to this treatment. Vedolizumab concentration was determined to be the strongest factor affecting clinical remission and response rates in patients with UC. After adjusting for confounding factors, increasing the cumulative average concentration through week 6 (C average) from 35 to 84\\xa0µg/mL was associated with a 15% increase in the probability of clinical remission and a 20% increase in the probability of clinical response at week\\xa06.\\nConsistent with positive exposure–efficacy relationships in patients with UC, the median vedolizumab trough serum concentration at week\\xa06 was higher in remitters [34.7 (95% confidence interval (CI) 31.7–36.6)\\xa0µg/mL] than in non-remitters [23.7 (22.0–24.8)\\xa0µg/mL] and also in responders [29.0 (27.3–31.7)\\xa0µg/mL] than in non-responders [21.5 (20.1–23.3)\\xa0µg/mL], although some overlap in concentrations was observed between the subgroups.\\nThe exposure–efficacy relationships of vedolizumab in patients with CD in the GEMINI\\xa02 and GEMINI\\xa03 studies were also assessed by analyzing the clinical remission and response rates by trough concentration quartile. Similar to the GEMINI\\xa01 analysis, any confounding factors for baseline covariates were assessed using logistic regression. Clinical remission was defined as a CDAI score ≤150\\xa0points, and clinical response was defined as a decrease from baseline in CDAI score ≥70\\xa0points.\\nFrom the quartile analyses, a modest, positive exposure–response relationship was evident for vedolizumab induction therapy, which was shallower than that observed for patients with UC. Vedolizumab concentrations >16.0\\xa0µg/mL in GEMINI\\xa02 and >17.1\\xa0µg/mL in GEMINI\\xa03 at week\\xa06 were associated with higher rates of clinical remission than those observed with placebo (Fig.\\xa05b, c). From concentration quartile\\xa01 to quartile\\xa04, the absolute rate increase for clinical remission was approximately 14% in GEMINI\\xa02 and only approximately 5% in GEMINI\\xa03 at week\\xa06 (Fig.\\xa05b, c). However, at week\\xa010, the absolute rate increase from quartile\\xa01 to quartile\\xa04 was approximately 22% for clinical remission in GEMINI\\xa03 (Fig.\\xa05d). These results may be a reflection of the fact that a higher percentage of patients with prior TNF-α antagonist failure were enrolled in GEMINI\\xa03 than in GEMINI\\xa02 (76 versus 58%), possibly representing a more treatment-refractory group of patients who may need a greater exposure of vedolizumab or more time to achieve remission than TNF-α antagonist-naïve patients.\\nFrom the logistic regression analysis, which accounted for baseline covariate effects, patients from GEMINI\\xa02 with higher baseline albumin concentrations, lower CRP concentrations, and no prior TNF-α antagonist use, on average, had a higher probability of clinical remission and response whether they were receiving placebo or vedolizumab. Similar to the results for patients with UC, prior TNF-α antagonist use had the largest effect on the probability of efficacy (10% higher probability of clinical remission for treatment-naïve patients). After adjusting for covariates, increasing C average from 32 to 85\\xa0µg/mL corresponded to an approximate 10% increase in the probability of clinical remission and 15% increase in the probability of clinical response at week\\xa06.\\nConsistent with these results, the median vedolizumab trough concentration at week\\xa06 was higher in remitters [26.8 (95% CI 24.9–30.1)\\xa0µg/mL] than in non-remitters [23.5 (22.4–24.8)\\xa0µg/mL] and also in responders [26.8 (25.2–27.7)\\xa0µg/mL] than in non-responders [22.1 (20.5–23.4)\\xa0µg/mL] in GEMINI\\xa02. However, the overlap in concentrations between the subgroups was greater than for patients with UC from GEMINI\\xa01.\\nSeveral factors may have contributed to the shallower exposure–efficacy relationships apparent in patients with CD than in patients with UC. Clinical remission rates were higher at week\\xa010 than at week\\xa06 in GEMINI\\xa02 and GEMINI\\xa03, particularly for patients who had previously not responded to TNF-α antagonist therapy. This\\xa0observation is reflected in the European prescribing information, which states that patients with CD who have not responded to vedolizumab therapy by week\\xa06 may be given an additional dose at week\\xa010 before being assessed for an induction response at week\\xa014. The exposure–efficacy relationships may have been steeper for patients with CD had a timepoint later than week\\xa06 been evaluated. The steeper exposure–efficacy relationship for clinical remission evident for patients from GEMINI\\xa03 at week\\xa010 than at week\\xa06 supports this hypothesis.\\nThe immunogenicity of vedolizumab was characterized throughout the clinical development program using screening and titration assays followed by a neutralizing assay. The screening assay was a validated bridging assay designed to detect the presence of ADAs in serum. In the presence of vedolizumab, low-titer responses were often undetectable [1\\xa0μg/mL of drug interfered with low and moderate levels of the control rabbit anti-vedolizumab antibodies (AVAs)]. For this reason, in the phase\\xa0III GEMINI studies, a two-prong approach was taken to ensure all individuals with AVAs were identified. First, the assay was run using two dilutions (1:5 and 1:50) and both had to be negative to be considered negative in the assay. The dilutions were used to increase the likelihood of an interaction between the detecting reagent and the AVA, and not the drug. The second approach was to take a sample at a timepoint where drug levels had cleared below interference levels, i.e., samples were also taken when the patients were off drug. After the initial screening assay, positive samples were confirmed with a titration assay. In the GEMINI studies, samples confirmed as ADA positive were further examined for their ability to neutralize vedolizumab activity.\\nIn the GEMINI 1 and GEMINI 2 combined population, 56\\xa0of 1434 (4%) patients who were treated continuously with vedolizumab for up to 52\\xa0weeks were ADA positive at any time during treatment (including the final safety visit); nine\\xa0of these patients (0.6%) were persistently positive (positive at two or more consecutive visits) and 33 (2.3%) developed neutralizing antibodies. None of the nine persistently positive patients achieved clinical remission at weeks\\xa06 or 52. As frequently occurs with monoclonal antibodies, the rate of immunogenicity during vedolizumab treatment may have been underestimated. Consistent with this possibility, among the 320 patients who were treated continuously with vedolizumab for up to 52\\xa0weeks in GEMINI\\xa01 and GEMINI\\xa02 and who had data available at the final safety visit (week\\xa066), 32 (10%) patients were ADA positive when off drug. While there was an increase in the overall immunogenicity rate off drug compared with on drug, when we examined the impact of the immunogenicity using either the 4% population or the 10–15% population, there was no significant difference between the populations with or without AVAs, suggesting that the impact of immunogenicity was adequately captured.\\nThe increase in the immunogenicity rate off drug compared with on drug suggests that low- to moderate-titer AVAs may have been present and unobservable. However, when comparing the results of the impact of AVAs on clinical safety, efficacy, and pharmacological parameters, only the presence of persistently positive samples resulted in any impact.\\nAn effect of concomitant immunomodulator therapy on the rate of ADA development was evident in those patients who received two doses of vedolizumab during induction and then placebo during maintenance. In the subgroup of these patients who were using immunomodulators at baseline (regardless of other concomitant medication use), only one of 32 patients (3%) was ADA positive (persistently positive) versus 44 of 247 patients (18%) who were not using immunomodulators at baseline [30 patients (12%) were persistently positive]. The impact of immunomodulator coadministration on the rate of ADA development in patients who were administered vedolizumab continuously during induction and maintenance was less obvious, potentially due to a smaller percentage of patients who developed ADA in this group. A total of five of 161 patients (3%) using immunomodulators at baseline were ADA positive (none were persistently positive) versus 51 of 1273 patients (4%) not using immunomodulators at baseline [nine patients (1%) were persistently positive].\\nIn the GEMINI\\xa01 and GEMINI\\xa02 studies, three of 61 patients (5%) who were treated with vedolizumab continuously for up to 52\\xa0weeks and who had an investigator-defined infusion-related reaction were persistently ADA positive. Three of the 56\\xa0patients (5%) who were persistently ADA positive in these studies experienced an infusion-related reaction.\\nThe pharmacokinetic profile of vedolizumab is characterized by a rapid, saturable, non-linear elimination process at low concentrations, presumably attributed to target-mediated elimination via interaction with α4β7 integrin, and a slower, linear elimination process (non-specific elimination) at higher concentrations (>10\\xa0μg/mL). At therapeutic concentrations, vedolizumab is primarily eliminated through the linear pathway. The distribution pharmacokinetics of vedolizumab was best described by a two-compartment model. The t ½ of vedolizumab was estimated to be 25.5\\xa0days. The pharmacokinetic properties of vedolizumab were similar in patients with UC and patients with CD. Of the covariates tested, extreme low serum albumin (<3.2\\xa0g/dL) and extreme high body weight (>120\\xa0kg) values were identified as potential clinically important predictors of vedolizumab CLL.\\nVedolizumab reversibly and maximally inhibited MAdCAM-1-Fc binding to α4β7 integrin on peripheral blood memory T\\xa0cells at all doses and timepoints at which vedolizumab was measurable in serum. Once vedolizumab was no longer detectable in serum, the inhibition of MAdCAM-1-Fc binding returned to baseline levels.\\nPositive exposure–efficacy relationships for vedolizumab induction therapy were evident for clinical remission and clinical response in patients with UC or CD. The relationships were steeper for patients with UC than for patients with CD. On average, patients with higher albumin, lower fecal calprotectin (UC only), lower CRP (CD only), and no prior TNF-α antagonist use had a higher probability of remission. Prior TNF-α antagonist use had the largest effect on the probability of efficacy in both diseases (10% higher probability of clinical remission for treatment-naïve patients). After adjusting for covariates, an increase in C average from 32 to 85\\xa0µg/mL corresponded to increases of approximately 15 and 10% in the probability of clinical remission in patients with UC and patients with CD, respectively. No strong conclusions can be drawn from the exposure–efficacy relationship because no dose-ranging studies have been performed. However, some patients may benefit from an extra dose at week\\xa010. The GEMINI\\xa01 and 2 studies reported greater than 95% α4β7 saturation on memory T\\xa0cells in peripheral blood, placing doubt regarding the viability of therapeutic drug monitoring for vedolizumab. A proposal for a therapeutic window for vedolizumab can only be addressed and validated by a prospective study.\\nThe rate of ADA development off drug was 10%. During treatment, a meaningful decrease in vedolizumab exposure was only observed in patients who were persistently ADA positive.\\nThe studies discussed in this review were funded by Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited.

       "    'fulltext': 'Vedolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the α4β7 integrin heterodimer. The United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved vedolizumab for the treatment of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis (UC) and moderate to severe Crohn’s disease (CD) in 2014.\\nUC, along with CD, is a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which are chronic inflammatory disorders affecting the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. UC, unlike CD, affects only the colon and rectum. In most cases of UC inflammation is limited to the mucosa; however, in severe cases the submucosa can be affected as well. In both UC and CD, inflammatory cells including neutrophils, macrophages, and T lymphocytes are recruited to the GI tract. T cells that express α4β7 are preferentially recruited to GI tissues. By blocking α4β7 vedolizumab decreases leukocyte migration into affected GI mucosa (Figure 1).\\nPatients with UC typically present with bloody diarrhea, fecal urgency, incontinence, tenesmus, and/or systemic symptoms such as fever, fatigue, or malaise. The diagnosis is suspected based on symptoms and laboratory investigation and is confirmed by histopathologic analysis of biopsies obtained during colonoscopy. Medical options for the treatment of UC include 5-aminosalicylates (5-ASAs), corticosteroids, immune suppressants, or biologic options such as TNF-α inhibitors or anti-integrin agents. The choice of medication is largely based on the severity of presentation, but other factors including side effects and cost are considered. Surgery remains an option for all patients with UC as proctocolectomy is curative. Patients with severe UC, those who fail medical therapy, or those who develop complications of disease may require surgery to achieve symptom control.\\nA variety of safe, effective treatment options exist for patients with mild to moderate UC. However, treatment of moderate to severe UC can be more challenging due to the severity of symptoms as well as potentially life-threatening complications, such as toxic megacolon, that may not respond adequately even to aggressive medical therapy. In such cases, colectomy is indicated. In fact, up to 25% of patients with UC will have surgery within 10 years of diagnosis. Available medical therapies include 5-ASAs, corticosteroids, immune suppressants, TNF-α inhibitors, and anti-integrin agents. Cyclosporine and tacrolimus can also be considered in UC patients who do not respond to intravenous steroids.\\nPatients with mild to moderate UC often respond to aminosalicylates, which can be used for both induction and maintenance therapy. A Cochrane Database review of 48 studies that enrolled 7,776 UC patients found that patients treated with placebo did not enter clinical remission as often as those treated with 5-ASA (RR 0.9, 95% CI 0.8 – 0.9). There was no difference between 5-ASA and sulfasalazine for inducing remission in patients with UC (RR 0.9, 95% CI 0.8 – 1.0). A second Cochrane Database review of 38 studies and 8,127 patients found that fewer patients receiving 5-ASA for UC maintenance therapy relapsed compared to those receiving placebo (RR 0.7, 95% CI 0.6 – 0.8). Sulfasalazine was found to be slightly more effective for maintaining remission than 5-ASA (RR 1.1, 95% CI 1.0 – 1.3). Aminosalicylates are generally well tolerated. However, they can be associated with mild side effects including headache, nausea, abdominal pain, decreased appetite, rash, vomiting, flatulence, and fever. In addition, up to 5% of patients taking 5-ASAs can develop a paradoxical worsening of diarrhea. Rarely, 5-ASAs can trigger interstitial nephritis.\\nCorticosteroids are highly effective for inducing remission in UC. A meta-analysis of 20 trials found that corticosteroids are superior to placebo for inducing remission in UC (RR 0.7, 95% CI 0.5 – 0.9). Oral prednisone exhibits a dose-response effect between 20 and 60 mg per day, although this increased efficacy is associated with a more significant side effect profile. Potential side effects include the development of cushingoid features, emotional or psychiatric disturbances, increased susceptibility to infection, glaucoma, gastric or duodenal mucosal injury, impaired wound healing, striae, metabolic bone disease, hyperglycemia, electrolyte disturbances, hyperlipidemia, adrenal insufficiency, and atherogenesis. Because of the multitude of serious side effects associated with corticosteroid use, long-term use as a maintenance agent is not appropriate.\\nImmune suppressants such as the thiopurines, 6-mercaptopurine (6MP) and azathioprine (AZA), may be used as steroid-sparing maintenance agents for patients with UC. Their utility is limited by their slow onset of action, which can take up to 6 months. Because of this, another agent such as a corticosteroid must be used to induce clinical remission. Additional considerations include side effects such as increased susceptibility to serious or opportunistic infection, bone marrow suppression, liver toxicity, hypersensitivity, and pancreatitis. Thiopurine therapy is also associated with an increased risk of non-melanoma skin cancer and lymphoma with risk of both conditions increasing with patient age. Although their use is associated with fewer hospitalizations, fewer operations, and steroid-free remission, a Cochrane analysis concluded that their use as first-line maintenance agents for UC could not be recommended given their less favorable side-effect profile when compared to 5-ASA therapy.\\nMonoclonal antibodies directed against the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α are steroid-sparing and can be used for induction and maintenance of remission in UC. Infliximab is the first TNF-α inhibitor approved for use in patients with IBD. The Active Ulcerative Colitis Trial (ACT) 1 demonstrated that at week 8 infliximab induces clinical response in approximately 65% of patients with moderate to severely active UC compared to 37% in those receiving placebo (p < 0.01) with clinical remission in 35% of those receiving infliximab compared to 15% of these receiving placebo (p < 0.01). At week 54 clinical response was observed in approximately 45% of those receiving infliximab compared to 20% of those receiving placebo (p < 0.01). Other TNF-α inhibitors approved in the US for treatment of moderate to severe UC are adalimumab and golimumab. The Ulcerative Colitis Long-term Remission and Maintenance with Adalimumab (ULTRA) trial demonstrated the efficacy of adalimumab over placebo for inducing and maintaining remission in patients with moderate to severe UC. Patients enrolled did not respond to steroid therapy or immune suppressants. Clinical remission was achieved in 16.5% of adalimumab-treated patients vs. 9.3% of placebo-treated patients at week 8 (p < 0.05) and 17.3% vs. 8.5% of patients at week 52 (p < 0.01). Response rates were 50.4% vs. 34.6% (adalimumab vs. placebo, p < 0.01) at week 8 and 30.2% vs. 18.3% (adalimumab vs. placebo, p < 0.05) at week 52. Similarly, the Program of Ulcerative Colitis Research Studies Utilizing an Investigation Treatment – Subcutaneous (PURSUIT-SC) study demonstrated the efficacy of golimumab for inducing and maintaining clinical response, remission, and mucosal healing in patients with moderate to severe UC. Like thiopurines, anti-TNF agents are associated with an increased risk of serious and opportunistic infections. In addition, patients using anti-TNF agents may develop infusion or injection site reactions, paradoxical autoimmune reactions, worsening heart failure, and melanoma skin cancers. Importantly, a proportion of patients treated with TNF-α inhibitors either will not respond (primary nonresponse) to anti-TNF therapy or lose response (secondary nonresponse) over time.\\nAlthough total proctocolectomy is curative, many patients do not wish to have a permanent end ileostomy. Patients who elect to undergo an ileal pouch anal anastomosis are subject to complications of the ileal pouch including pouchitis, sexual dysfunction, incontinence, irritable pouch syndrome, and a small risk of developing pouch dysplasia over time. Patients must also be counseled regarding normal pouch function and should expect 4–8 bowel movements per day.\\nVedolizumab is a humanized version of a murine antibody (Act-1) that was originally developed in the 1980s. Act-1 binds the α4β7-integrin heterodimer, which facilitates leukocyte extravasation into GI tissues (Figure 1). Vedolizumab has since been reformulated as the rate of antibody development observed in patients receiving earlier versions of vedolizumab was unexpectedly high.\\nThe α4β7 integrin is expressed on T cells and binds to mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule (MAdCAM)-1, which is found on endothelial cells in venules within the GI tract and on high endothelial venules in gut-associated lymphoid tissue, including Peyer’s patches and mesenteric lymph nodes. MAdCAM-1 plays an important role in leukocyte recruitment to GI tissue as murine studies found that blockade of either MAdCAM-1 or α4β7 inhibits migration of memory and effector T cells to GI tissue. Other sites of MAdCAM-1 expression in humans include the pancreas and lymphoid tissue with increased expression in inflamed GI mucosa, but not at inflamed extra-intestinal sites. By blocking the ability of α4β7 and MAdCAM-1 to bind, vedolizumab prevents leukocytes from binding to venules within GI endothelium as well as subsequent leukocyte extravasation into GI mucosa (Figure 1).\\nThe chemical name for vedolizumab is immunoglobulin G1-kappa, anti-human integrin lymphocyte Peyer’s patch adhesion molecule 1 (human-Mus musculus heavy chain), disulfide with human-Mus musculus α-chain, dimer. Prior names include LDP-02, LPD-02, MLN-0002, MLN-002, MLN-02, and UNII-9RV78Q2002. Vedolizumab is currently marketed by Takeda Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. under the trade name “Entyvio”. Vedolizumab’s molecular formula is C6528H10072N1732O2042S42. It has a molecular weight of 146.837 kDa and its Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) registry number is 943609-66-3.\\nVedolizumab’s specificity for the α4β7-integrin heterodimer has been established in animal and human studies. A non-human primate chronic colitis model was used to determine the effect of α4β7 blockade on GI inflammation. Animals were treated with a monoclonal antibody directed against α4β7 with subsequent improvement in stool consistency, decreased mucosal infiltration of lymphocytes, neutrophils, and macrophages, and decreased histological inflammation within the GI tract. Importantly, antibodies to α4β7 did not inhibit lymphocyte recruitment to extraintestinal sites. Human tissue was also used to study the effect of α4β7 blockade. Cells expressing α4β7 were strongly positive in the stomach, small intestine, colon, and spleen, with moderate signal in lymphoid tissues. Flow cytometry was used to confirm vedolizumab binding to immune cells rather than other cell types. Vedolizumab was found to bind B cells, naïve CD4 and CD8 T cells, memory CD4 and CD8 cells, natural killer cells, and basophils. Monocyte binding was minimal and binding to neutrophils did not occur. Vedolizumab had the greatest affinity for memory CD4 T cells expressing the α4β7-integrin heterodimer. It is this T-cell population that is thought to be pathogenic in IBD. By targeting the α4β7-integrin heterodimer, vedolizumab is able to inhibit the pathologic effects of this T-cell population on GI tissue without suppressing the protective effects of these T-cells at extraintestinal sites or the protective effects of other nonpathogenic T-cell subsets.\\nA prior formulation of vedolizumab was found to promote the development of antidrug antibodies. In Phase II studies, human anti-human antibodies (HAHA) developed in approximately 40% of participants receiving this formulation of vedolizumab. These antibodies were associated with decreased drug binding at α4β7 as well as decreased drug efficacy. As a result, vedolizumab was reformulated in an effort to produce a less immunogenic antibody. The reformulated vedolizumab underwent testing to reevaluate pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and drug safety. Binding to α4β7 was nearly 100% in all dosing groups studied (2 mg/kg, 6 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg). In the presence of detectable vedolizumab, the maximum effect (Emax) was > 95% in all treatment arms, indicating near complete saturation at α4β7. Since the Emax was >95% in all treatment arms, the authors were unable to determine a dose or concentration-dependent response relationship because there were no arms in which receptor saturation was not near complete.\\nData regarding the pharmacokinetics of vedolizumab were obtained in the Phase II study described above. Study participants received induction doses of vedolizumab on days 1, 15, and 29 with their first maintenance dose administered 8 weeks later on day 85. Serum vedolizumab concentrations increased with escalating doses. The maximum serum concentration and area under the curve increased in a linear fashion with increasing doses. Concentrations fell monoexponentially after the final dose until they were between 1–10 µg/mL at which point the decline continued in a nonlinear fashion. The mean elimination half-life was 15–22 days. The manner in which vedolizumab is metabolized has not been reported, although it is expected that it is degraded to small peptides and amino acids.\\nPhase III trials of vedolizumab reported additional pharmacokinetic data. In this study the mean trough concentration of vedolizumab at week 6 was 27.9±15.5 µg per mL with a steady state concentration of 11.2±7.2 µg per mL with vedolizumab administered every 8 weeks. Greater than 95% saturation of α4β7 on CD4+CD45RO+ T cells was observed. Twenty-three (3.7%) patients receiving vedolizumab had anti-vedolizumab antibodies at one point during the trial, with 6 patients (1.0%) having samples that were positive on ≥ 2 consecutive samples. The administration of immunosuppressive agents reportedly reduced the formation of anti-vedolizumab antibodies; however, these data were not presented in the referenced study. At present, there is no commercially available assay for measuring vedolizumab levels or antibodies against vedolizumab.\\nVedolizumab was approved for the treatment of moderate to severe UC and CD by the US FDA in 2014 and was also approved by the European Union European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the same indications in addition to other countries and regions for similar indications. As such, it is currently undergoing post-marketing surveillance with no unexpected safety signals reported to date.\\nResults from a Phase I study of LDP02 (vedolizumab) were presented in abstract form at Digestive Disease Week (DDW) 2000. This double-blind, placebo controlled, ascending dose trial evaluated the safety and efficacy of LDP02 in 29 patients with moderately severe UC (Table 1). Patients were required to have a Mayo Clinic Score (MCS) of at least 5, greater than or equal to 3 bowel movements daily above baseline, and endoscopic evidence of active disease. Placebo or LDP02 at one of four doses (0.15 mg/kg subcutaneous, 0.15 mg/kg intravenous, 0.5 mg/kg intravenous, 2.0 mg/kg intravenous) was administered. MCS and endoscopic disease activity were reassessed at day 30. No acute drug reactions occurred with headache being the most common adverse event reported. Saturation of the α4β7 receptor persisted to day 30 in the 0.5 mg/kg group. The authors concluded that α4β7 blockade persists for at least 30 days after a single dose of LDP02 and that LDP02 was well tolerated.\\nA multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase II trial of MLN02 (vedolizumab) was performed to determine its ability to induce remission in patients with active UC. This study assigned 181 patients to intravenous placebo, MLN02 0.5 mg/kg, or MLN02 2.0 mg/kg administered on day 1 and day 29 (Table 2). The primary endpoint was clinical remission at week 6. Endoscopic disease activity was also determined at that time point. Clinical remission rates were higher in the MLN02 0.5 mg/kg and MLN02 2.0 mg/kg groups (33% and 32%, respectively) than the placebo group (14%, p < 0.05). Clinical scores also improved to a greater extent in the MLN02 groups (66% and 53%) than in the placebo group (33%, p < 0.01). Mucosal healing was achieved in 28% of subjects receiving MLN02 0.5 mg/kg, 12% of subjects receiving MLN02 2.0 mg/kg, and 8% of subjects receiving placebo (p < 0.01). Adverse events were similar in all three treatment arms with exacerbation of UC, nausea, and headache being the most common side effects. A Phase II study examining the efficacy of MLN02 for the treatment of CD also found similar adverse event rates in treatment and placebo arms. Both the UC and CD Phase II studies found no difference in circulating lymphocyte counts between patients receiving MLN02 and those receiving placebo.\\nA second Phase II trial designed to examine vedolizumab’s pharmacology and safety profile was conducted. This study enrolled 47 patients with endoscopic and/or histopathologically confirmed UC of at least 2 years duration as well as a partial Mayo score of 1 – 7 (Table 2). Participants received placebo, vedolizumab 2 mg/kg, vedolizumab 6 mg/kg, or vedolizumab 10 mg/kg and were followed for 253 days. During this period two serious adverse events were reported (compression fractures of thoracic vertebrae and gastroduodenitis). Both adverse events were determined to be moderate and unrelated to vedolizumab. No systemic opportunistic infections or neoplasms were reported. Maximal saturation of α4β7 occurred at all drug doses studied. Higher antibody concentrations were detected in lower dose vedolizumab groups with no antibodies detected in the higher dose group. Even though the study was not designed to detect differences in efficacy, participants who received vedolizumab more frequently achieved a clinical response than those receiving placebo.\\nA randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled Phase III trial (GEMINI I) examining the effect of vedolizumab on 895 patients with active UC was published in 2013 (Tables 3 & 4). This study reported the results of two integrated trials. The first trial included 374 patients receiving vedolizumab 300 mg or placebo at weeks 0 and 2. The second trial included 521 patients receiving open-label vedolizumab at weeks 0 and 2. Patients were re-evaluated at week 6. Patients who responded to vedolizumab therapy at week 6 were subsequently assigned to either continue to receive vedolizumab every 4 or 8 weeks or placebo. More patients receiving vedolizumab had a clinical response than those receiving placebo (47% vs. 26%, p < 0.01) at week 6. Remission was maintained in more patients receiving vedolizumab every 4 or 8 weeks than in those receiving placebo (45% vs. 42% vs. 16%, p < 0.01).\\nAn additional Phase III study (GEMINI LTS) is no longer recruiting participants and is scheduled to conclude in 2016. This multicenter, open-label study is designed to determine the safety and efficacy of long-term vedolizumab therapy. Primary outcome measures include adverse events, serious adverse events, results of standard laboratory tests, rates of hospitalization, surgery, or procedure, and changes in quality of life.\\nVedolizumab is currently undergoing post-marketing surveillance. No unanticipated safety signals have been reported and there have been no cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) linked to vedolizumab.\\nIn Phase I, II, and III studies there were no differences in the rates of adverse events observed between patients receiving vedolizumab and those receiving placebo. Adverse events that did occur include headache, nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain, fatigue, and nasopharyngitis. One case of primary cytomegalovirus infection did occur in a patient who received two doses of vedolizumab; however, the patient improved without antiviral therapy. Although serious infections have occurred in patients receiving vedolizumab, no increase in infection risk, including serious infections and opportunistic infections, has been detected compared to those receiving placebo. In total, 17 patients exposed to vedolizumab were diagnosed with a malignancy. Malignancies developed in 6 (0.4%) of 1434 subjects receiving vedolizumab as part of a clinical trial. One subject (0.3%) out of 297 receiving placebo developed a malignancy. Six deaths were reported during clinical trials evaluating vedolizumab, 5 in patients receiving vedolizumab and 1 in a patient receiving placebo. The prescribing information for Entyvio (R) lists nasopharyngitis, headache, cough, bronchitis, influenza, back pain, rash, pruritus, sinusitis, oropharyngeal pain, and pain in extremities as the most common adverse reactions, although these reactions occur at a similar rate in patients receiving placebo. Additional data regarding the safety of long-term vedolizumab use will be reported in GEMINI LTS.\\nWith regard to PML, no cases have occurred to date in patients receiving vedolizumab. Unlike natalizumab, which is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the α4 integrin, vedolizumab does not cross into the central nervous system because of its increased specificity targeting the α4β7 heterodimer rather than α4 alone (Figure 1). PML is a rare and often fatal neurological disease caused by the John Cunningham (JC) virus. In patients receiving natalizumab, the risk of developing PML is increased by ≥ 2 years of natalizumab therapy, JC virus seropositivity, and prior exposure to immune suppressants with an estimated incidence of 1.44 cases per 1000 patient years (95% CI 1.2 – 1.7).\\nIn a Phase II pharmacologic study of reformulated vedolizumab, no changes in white blood cell subsets or counts were observed between participants who received vedolizumab and those receiving placebo. In this same study, HAHA were detected in 4 patients (11%); three patients from the 2 mg/kg cohort and one from the 6 mg/kg cohort. No patients receiving 10 mg/kg developed HAHAs. One HAHA positive patient (titer 1:15,625) had accelerated drug clearance. The remaining three HAHA positive patients did not clear drug at an accelerated rate, although their titers were low (≤ 1:15). These data suggest that antibodies against vedolizumab can increase drug clearance and, as is observed with infliximab and adalimumab, likely affects drug efficacy.\\nVedolizumab is approved by both the US FDA and the EMA for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe CD or moderate to severe UC who have had an inadequate response to, loss of response to, or were intolerant to either conventional therapy or TNF-α inhibitor therapy. Health Canada approved vedolizumab for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe UC who have had an inadequate response, loss of response to, or were intolerant to either conventional therapy or infliximab. Vedolizumab has also been approved in variety of other countries and regions in addition to the US, EU, and Canada.\\nAlthough multiple agents exist for the treatment of patients with UC, a proportion of patients will not respond even to maximal medical therapy with traditional immune suppressants or with TNF-α inhibitors. As a result, medical therapies for the treatment of both UC continue to evolve. Vedolizumab is the first anti-integrin agent approved by the US FDA for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe UC. Although vedolizumab only recently gained regulatory approval, other anti-integrin agents are in various stages of development and will likely join the market in coming years.\\nPhase I, Phase II, and Phase III studies have all established the safety and efficacy of vedolizumab for treatment of patients with moderate to severely active UC. Importantly, PML has not been reported to date, either in clinical trials or in post-marketing surveillance. Safety data continues to emerge and additional findings from long-term prospective studies will increase our understanding of any potential complications associated with long-term vedolizumab use. Currently, vedolizumab is well-positioned for use in UC patients not responding to, or losing response to, one or more anti-TNF agents. Vedolizumab may also be used for maintenance therapy in patients not previously exposed to anti-TNF agents, particularly in older patients or in others who may be at increased susceptibility for infection.\\nVedolizumab is a promising new agent recently approved for the treatment of patients with moderate to severely active CD or UC who have had an inadequate response to, lost response to, or are intolerant of anti-TNF or immunomodulator therapy, or who have an inadequate response, are intolerant of, or who are corticosteroid dependent. Previously, patients who did not respond to 5ASA therapy, immune suppressants, and anti-TNF therapy required colectomy. By targeting the α4β7 integrin heterodimer, vedolizumab prevents leukocyte migration into GI tissue, thereby reducing inflammation without affecting systemic immune surveillance and is approved for improving endoscopic appearance of mucosa and achieving corticosteroid-free remission in UC in addition to achieving clinical response, clinical remission, and corticosteroid-free remission in CD. Natalizumab, approved for the treatment of patients with CD, is a monoclonal antibody with less specificity than vedolizumab. It does affect systemic immune surveillance, particularly CNS immune surveillance, and is associated with PML. In addition, vedolizumab likely offers an enhanced safety profile compared to thiopurines and anti-TNF agents as blockade of leukocyte migration is largely restricted to GI tissues, rather than blunting the immune response systemically. Unlike anti-TNF agents, vedolizumab has a slower onset of action and co-induction with corticosteroids may be required in patients with more severe symptoms.\\nVedolizumab is approved for the treatment of patients with moderate to severely active UC (vedolizumab is also approved for the treatment of patients with moderate to severely active Crohn’s disease). In moderate to severely symptomatic patients, remission may be induced with anti-TNF agents or corticosteroids (intravenous or oral) with transition to a maintenance agent. If remission is successfully induced with an anti-TNF agent, that drug should be continued for maintenance therapy. For patients who undergo corticosteroid induction, options for maintenance therapy include anti-TNF agents, immune suppressants, combination therapy (anti-TNF therapy with immune suppressant), or anti-integrin therapy with or without an immune suppressant. Determining which maintenance agent to use is based on patient factors (i.e., disease severity, adverse reactions), convenience (i.e., route of delivery, frequency of dosing), whether the ability to perform therapeutic drug monitoring is desired, and cost. In addition to using vedolizumab as a maintenance agent after corticosteroid induction, vedolizumab may be considered in patients with primary non-response to anti-TNF induction or in patients who develop secondary non-response to one or more anti-TNF agents. Finally, vedolizumab may be considered in patients with a history of infectious, paradoxical autoimmune, and malignant complications on other immune suppressants or biologic agents, in patients with prior malignancy, or in patients at increased risk for infection such as older patients since gut selective anti-integrin antibodies were not associated with an increased risk of infection (RR 1.6, 95% CI 0.2 – 14.8) in a meta-analysis of placebo-controlled anti-integrin trials.\\nVedolizumab use has steadily increased in our clinical practice and we expect that its use at academic tertiary medical centers as well as in community practices will continue to grow. As stated previously, vedolizumab not only adds to the number of agents available for use in UC, it expands our ability to treat inflammation associated with IBD by targeting the α4β7 integrin, a receptor not previously subject to antibody blockade in patients with UC. Some physicians may continue to steer patients towards anti-TNF agents since they have been used in the US since 1998. As such, we are approaching 20 years of post-marketing data with a good understanding of the side effect profile associated with these agents. Vedolizumab, however, has only recently been approved for use in the US and other regions. Assuming no unanticipated safety signals emerge in the post-marketing surveillance period, including a continued absence of PML in patients receiving vedolizumab, its use in patients with UC will continue to expand.\\nStudies are now emerging, including meta-analyses of placebo-controlled anti-integrin trials, in an attempt to expand the data available regarding the side effect profile of these agents. One meta-analysis included data from 12 trials (4 natalizumab, 6 vedolizumab, 2 etrolizumab) and found that the risk of developing an opportunistic infection was not increased with either gut-specific (RR 1.6, 95% CI 0.2 – 14.8) or gut-nonspecific (RR 2.3, 95% CI 0.1 – 108) anti-integrin agents. Gut-specific (RR 0.8, 95% CI 0.2 – 4.0) and gut-nonspecific (RR 1.6, 95% CI 0.2 – 12.7) anti-integrin agents were not associated with higher rates of malignancy. Large prospective studies will, however, be required to more clearly establish risk of infectious complications and malignancy in patients treated with anti-integrin agents for extended periods of time. Furthermore, although mechanistically vedolizumab should not cause PML, continued vigilance and monitoring for this unlikely complication is warranted.\\nAnti-integrin agents continue to be developed. Over the next 5 years we expect that other anti-integrin agents will gain regulatory approval and enter the market. A commercially available assay for drug monitoring will permit gastroenterologists to adjust dosing to ensure adequate drug levels in patients receiving vedolizumab. As serum biomarkers improve and advances are made in the realm of personalized medicine, it is likely that drug therapy will be tailored to the individuals, permitting physicians to choose agents that will have optimal effect in a particular patient while minimizing risks of adverse reactions. Until then, vedolizumab will remain a very reasonable choice for maintenance therapy in patients either intolerant of or not responding to anti-TNF agents or as first-line maintenance therapy in patients with UC.\\nPapers of special note have been highlighted as either of interest (•) or of considerable interest (••) to readers.\\nVedolizumab\\nPost Marketing Surveillance\\nUS/EU: Patients with moderate to severe UC or CD who have had no response, lost response, or were intolerant to conventional therapy or TNF-α inhibitor therapy.\\nCanada: Patients with moderate to severe UC who have had no response, lost response, or were intolerant to conventional therapy or TNF-α inhibitor therapy.\\nHumanized monoclonal antibody directed against α4β7-integrin heterodimer.

Few studies have evaluated the effects of integrin inhibitors such as vedolizumab in patients with PSC.\\nIn analyses of serum samples from patients in a large international uncontrolled study, we found that patients with PSC and IBD treated with vedolizumab had a small increase in liver enzymes and bilirubin levels at end of the follow-up period. However, one-fifth had a significant reduction in level of alkaline phosphatase regardless of use of ursodeoxycholic acid. The endoscopic response of IBD in patients with PSC and IBD did not differ significantly from that reported for patients with only IBD.\\nAlthough we did not find evidence for a biochemical response to vedolizumab in patients with IBD and PSC, the response was heterogeneous—a subset of patients might benefit from therapy. Vedolizumab seems to be safe in patients with PSC and IBD.\\nThe close association of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has long suggested that common pathophysiological mechanisms acting in the liver and intestine could be found and targeted therapeutically. Although liver disease and intestinal inflammation in PSC can progress along apparently independent courses, they also influence one another, such as increased post-transplant PSC recurrence in patients who have a pouch or intact colon and the increased risk of colorectal cancer in patients with IBD with PSC as compared with IBD alone. Furthermore, the phenotype of IBD in PSC has particular characteristics, such as involvement of the entire colon with right-sided dominance, ileal inflammation, and relative rectal sparing. Some investigators suggest that the IBD associated with PSC is its own distinct entity separate from ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn’s disease alone (CD). However, despite recent advances in the characterization of PSC and\\xa0the IBD associated with PSC, no proven beneficial medical therapy is available to slow the progression to advanced liver disease and/or malignancy, and the prognosis of patients with PSC remains guarded.\\nIn contrast, there are several effective treatments for IBD, including recently developed targeted biologic therapies. One such is vedolizumab, which blocks the α4β7 integrin, and is effective in CD and UC. Several studies suggest that the particular gut-homing pathway that vedolizumab targets (namely the interaction between α4β7 and its ligand, mucosal addressin cellular adhesion molecule-1) is implicated in the pathophysiology of PSC. This includes overexpression of mucosal addressin cellular adhesion molecule-1 in the PSC hepatic endothelial cells, and related integrins and chemokine ligands, which can promote α4β7/mucosal addressin cellular adhesion molecule-1 interactions, such as vascular adhesion protein-1 and CC-chemokine ligand 25, respectively. Therefore, it is possible that vedolizumab may play a role in reducing lymphocyte infiltration into the liver in patients with PSC and thereby in reducing hepatic and biliary inflammation. Indeed, it has been shown that vedolizumab can induce clinical remission in rheumatologic extraintestinal manifestations of IBD.\\nThis hypothesis has not been tested in clinical trials, although a few observational studies published recently document the clinical experience of treating patients who have PSC and IBD with vedolizumab. These cohorts are usually limited to a small number of centers, leading to a small sample size. We sought to contribute to this literature by documenting our experience in a larger international cohort of patients with PSC and IBD.\\nA retrospective analysis was carried out on patients with PSC and IBD receiving vedolizumab as indicated for their IBD (UC, CD, or IBD-unspecified). Investigators from 20 centers across Europe and North America who are active members of the International PSC Study Group contributed patient data (Supplementary Table\\xa01). To be eligible for inclusion in the dataset, patients must have been diagnosed with PSC according to internationally accepted guidelines, have received a minimum of 3 doses of vedolizumab for their IBD, have baseline (prevedolizumab) and follow-up blood tests including liver biochemistry, have commenced vedolizumab with their native liver still in situ, and received vedolizumab according to the usual dosing schedule as licensed.\\nThe effect of vedolizumab on progression of PSC was evaluated by analyzing the change in liver biochemistry from baseline to various time points when on vedolizumab. This was done in 2 ways.\\nFirst, we analyzed the overall change in alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and bilirubin levels at baseline, Week 6 (ie, Day 42), Week 14 (ie, Day 96), and last follow-up while on vedolizumab. For further details on the time-points collected, see the Supplementary Methods.\\nSecond, we deduced the proportion of patients whose ALP dropped by 20% or more from baseline to last follow-up. This proportionate drop was chosen because it was believed to represent a drop of ALP of a larger magnitude than what would usually be considered to occur as part of the natural history of the disease and therefore considered clinically significant. We also calculated the proportion of patients whose ALP rose by 20% from baseline to last follow-up, and those whose ALP remained stable (ie, ± 20%).\\nWe sought to collect endoscopic IBD response, classified as improved, or unchanged/worsened (as judged by the treating clinician), and endoscopic scores at baseline and on vedolizumab where available, namely the Mayo Endoscopic Subscore, the Ulcerative Colitis Endoscopic Index of Severity, and the Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn’s Disease. We also looked at whether there was an association between endoscopic IBD response and change in ALP at last follow-up using the univariate analyses described later.\\nFinally, we collected liver-related outcomes, which included any of the following: listing for liver transplantation (LT), undergoing LT, ascending cholangitis, new-onset ascites, variceal bleed, hepatic encephalopathy, cholangiocarcinoma, and death.\\nPaired Student t tests or Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank tests were used according to whether the data was distributed parametrically or nonparametrically, respectively. Univariate logistic regression and multivariate logistic regression were carried out to assess the impact of relevant variables on ALP changes from baseline to last follow-up. The Supplementary Methods provide detailed information on statistical analyses.\\nOf 133 patients whose data were contributed, 102 patients met inclusion criteria for the study. Reasons for exclusion were incomplete ALP data (n\\xa0= 15), first dose of vedolizumab received after LT (n\\xa0= 13), and less than 3 doses of vedolizumab administered (n\\xa0= 3). Table\\xa01 summarizes baseline demographics, clinical, and laboratory information for the 102 study subjects: 64/102 (62.8%) were male, and most patients had classical large-duct PSC (90.2%). One-fifth of patients had cirrhosis at baseline, and most patients had associated UC (64.7%).\\nThe median duration of vedolizumab treatment was 412 days (interquartile range [IQR], 180–651; range, 37–2609). See Supplementary Results for further information re vedolizumab duration, follow-up, and time-points of last follow-up liver biochemistry variables. Forty-four patients discontinued use of vedolizumab, predominantly for lack of efficacy (72.3%) and adverse events (13.6%).\\nIn the total cohort, there was a small increase in liver enzymes over time (Figure\\xa01). The median ALP gradually increased from baseline (1.54\\xa0× upper limit of normal [ULN]; IQR, 0.86–2.67) to last follow-up (1.64\\xa0× ULN; IQR, 1.04–3.47; P\\xa0= .018), with similar to intermediate values at Week 6 (1.55\\xa0× ULN; IQR, 0.82–2.95; P\\xa0= .084) and Week 14 (1.64\\xa0× ULN; IQR, 1.00–3.61; P\\xa0= .52). A comparable increase was seen for median ALT (baseline, 38 IU/L; IQR, 22–76 vs last follow-up, 53 IU/L; IQR, 29–100; P\\xa0= .002), median AST (baseline, 38 IU/L; IQR, 23–69 vs last follow-up, 49 IU/L; IQR, 27–93; P\\xa0= .0002), and median bilirubin (baseline, 10 μmol/L; IQR, 7–16 vs last follow-up, 12 μmol/L; IQR, 8–21; P\\xa0= .0002).\\nTwenty-one (20.6%) patients had an ALP drop ≥20% from baseline to last follow-up. Thirty-nine patients (38.2%) had a stable ALP, whereas 42 patients (41.2%) had ALP increase by ≥20% at last follow-up (Figure\\xa02). The trajectories of the ALP from baseline over time are shown in Supplementary Figure\\xa01.\\nOn univariate analysis, the presence of cirrhosis was associated with an ALP drop of ≥20% from baseline to last follow-up (odds ratio, 4.70; 95% confidence interval, 1.61–13.76) (Table\\xa02). This finding was reproduced on multivariate analysis. No other variables were associated with ≥20% ALP drop, including ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) use at baseline. However, we observed a trend toward an association with a raised baseline ALP, and having CD or IBD-unspecified rather than UC. Twenty-nine percent of female patients and 42.9% of patients with cirrhosis achieved such drop in ALP compared with 15.6% of males and 13.8% of patients without cirrhosis. Of note, only 3 of the 21 patients with an ALP drop ≥20% had a normal ALP at baseline. No variables were associated with ALP increase ≥20% from baseline (Supplementary Table\\xa03).\\nRefer to Supplementary Results for additional analyses carried out on specific cohorts, including patients with cirrhosis, those not on UDCA, those who had been on vedolizumab for a minimum of 6 months, and those with baseline ALP >1.5\\xa0× ULN.\\nData on endoscopic response to vedolizumab at baseline and at follow-up were available for 74 patients. The median duration from vedolizumab initiation to follow-up endoscopy was 227 days (IQR, 130–336; range, 67–2540). Forty-two patients (56.8%) had an endoscopic IBD response, with the remainder worsened or unchanged. Normal ALP at baseline and longer vedolizumab duration were associated with an endoscopic IBD response, although type of IBD was not associated (Supplementary Table\\xa06).\\nEndoscopic scores were available for a subset of patients (Figure\\xa03). Among patients with UC, the mean endoscopic scores dropped prevedolizumab versus postvedolizumab for Mayo Endoscopic Subscore (2.2 ± 0.8 to 1.4 ± 0.9; P\\xa0= .0008) and Ulcerative Colitis Endoscopic Index of Severity (4.2 ± 1.5 to 2.5 ± 2.0; P\\xa0= .028). Among patients with CD, Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn’s Disease prevedolizumab and postvedolizumab was only available for 5 patients and there was a numerical improvement in mean Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn’s Disease (17.0 ± 9.1 to 8.8 ± 11.0; P\\xa0= .215).\\nSafety and liver-related outcomes were calculated for the 102 patients described previously, and the 3 patients who had received fewer than 3 vedolizumab infusions and had follow-up liver biochemistry data (1 infusion [n\\xa0= 2]) and 2 infusions [n\\xa0= 1]). Of these 105 patients, a 3-fold elevation in ALP, ALT, and AST from baseline to last follow-up was observed in 6 (5.7%), 11 (10.4%), and 3 (2.9%) patients; doubling of total bilirubin was noted in 21 (20.0%).\\nTwenty-two patients (20.9%) experienced a liver-related outcome over the median follow-up period of 561 days. Twelve patients (11.4%) were listed for LT, of whom 8 (7.6%) underwent LT. Nine patients (8.8%) experienced at least 1 episode of cholangitis and 6 patients (5.9%) had new-onset ascites. No patient experienced a variceal bleed, nor developed cholangiocarcinoma, and there were no deaths. On univariate analysis, cirrhosis, baseline ALP >ULN, and baseline albumin level were associated with the occurrence of a liver-related outcome (Supplementary Table\\xa07). Among patients with cirrhosis (n\\xa0= 21), 3/9 (33.3%) of patients who had an ALP drop ≥20% had a liver-related complication, compared with 7/12 (58.3%) who did not have an ALP drop ≥20%.\\nThe data presented here, which represent an international, multicenter experience, add substantially to the existing literature on the subject of patients with PSC exposed to vedolizumab. The demographics of the cohort closely resembled that reported in the literature, with most having large-duct PSC, two-thirds having UC, and one-third CD or IBD-unspecified, a proportion having advanced liver disease, and just under two-thirds being on UDCA treatment. The median age at PSC diagnosis of 31.4 years is slightly lower than in the literature (40 years), which may reflect the demographic who have more active IBD or are more likely to receive a biologic therapy. However, one should keep in mind that this cohort has active IBD, which in itself is a minority of the PSC demographic, because most patients with PSC have fairly quiescent IBD, not requiring biologic therapy (or, 20%–40% do not have IBD at all). Therefore, the effect of vedolizumab in PSC with inactive IBD or no IBD has never been observed or evaluated.\\nIt is immediately apparent that there is heterogeneity with regard to changes in ALP, an important marker of cholestasis. The reduction in ALP of ≥20% from baseline in a subset of treated patients may indicate a biologic effect of vedolizumab in patients with PSC, although a more pronounced spontaneous fluctuation cannot be excluded. ALP is thought to be a potential surrogate marker for clinical outcome in PSC, and has been proposed by a panel of experts as an important endpoint in clinical trials. Although spontaneous normalization of ALP has been described in a variable proportion of patients with PSC irrespective of endoscopic intervention or use of UDCA, the natural history of PSC is for the ALP level to remain relatively stable or increase slightly over time. For instance, in a recent clinical trial investigating the role of norUDCA on patients with PSC, the 40 patients on placebo had a mean relative change of 1.2% increase over the 12-week study duration. Therefore, the observed reduction in ALP by ≥20% in a subset of patients on vedolizumab suggests a possible therapeutic signal worthy of additional investigation. However, a drop in ALP does not necessarily correlate with improved clinical outcome. As seen in the high-dose UDCA trial for patients with PSC, those on UDCA experienced a significant drop in ALP as compared with placebo, but developed more liver-related clinical endpoints.\\nIn the cohort overall, the median values for ALP, AST, ALT, and bilirubin all increased from baseline to last follow-up on vedolizumab. This increase, however, was small, and may reflect changes commensurate with the natural history and progression of the disease. Median ALP rose from 1.54\\xa0× ULN to 1.64\\xa0× ULN, which is equivalent to 184 to 197 IU/L (if ULN\\xa0= 120 IU/L). This is itself a clinically insignificant increase, and therefore, when viewed overall, the increase in ALP is unlikely to represent a significant safety signal.\\nThe drop in ALP of ≥20% was associated with cirrhosis and there was a trend toward an association with a higher ALP at baseline. Patients with cirrhosis and those with a raised ALP are potentially more likely to have a more inflammatory and progressive form of PSC, and therefore may theoretically benefit more substantially from an anti-inflammatory effect of reduced migration of lymphocytes to the liver. Furthermore, vedolizumab is degraded to smaller peptides and amino acids to be excreted by the kidneys, and this process is partially done by hepatic proteolytic degradation. Cirrhosis may reduce/slow the breakdown of vedolizumab thereby leading to higher serum concentrations, possibly leading to greater clinical effect.\\nIt is difficult to conclude whether this association of cirrhosis with ALP reduction ≥20% is a true finding or a spurious one. Within that cohort of patients with cirrhosis, we could not show that changes in ALP correlated with changes in liver synthetic function, such as bilirubin and international normalized ratio. In any case, there was no clear indication that patients with cirrhosis did worse on vedolizumab, and should a future prospective trial be carried out in PSC, it would be important to include patients with compensated cirrhosis and explore this association further.\\nChristensen et\\xa0al also observed an association of an elevated ALP at baseline with subsequent reduction after treatment with vedolizumab. In their study, when examining patients with raised ALP at baseline, 11/18 patients (69%) had an ALP drop, with median ALP going from 475 IU/L at baseline to 322.5 IU/L at Week 14 and 283 IU/L at Week 30. In patients with normal ALP at baseline, there was a trend for the ALP to increase slightly. Equally, these findings should be interpreted with caution, because statistical regression to the mean may account for the association with a higher ALP at baseline, and we were unable in this retrospective study to distinguish hepatic, intestinal, and other isoforms of ALP.\\nOne fifth of our cohort (22/105) experienced a liver-related outcome. This may be slightly overrepresented by the occurrence of cholangitis (8.8%), which in itself, unless recurrent and refractory to oral antibiotics, is not necessarily an indication of advanced liver disease requiring LT. If we exclude those with cholangitis only (7/9), then 14/102 (13.7%) experienced a liver-related outcome. These findings are similar to the recently reported trial of anti-LOXL-2 antibody, simtuzumab, in PSC, where 47/234 patients (20.1%) experienced a PSC-related event, with an overrepresentation of cholangitis (n\\xa0= 31, or 13.2% of total cohort). This proportion of liver-related outcomes is consistent with the natural history of PSC and does not by itself indicate that vedolizumab treatment is harmful in PSC.\\nIt is important to highlight the fact that a significant proportion of patients had an endoscopic IBD response, both as reported by the treating clinician (42/74 patients; 56.8%) and by the more robust measure of drop in individual endoscopic scores (particularly Mayo Endoscopic Subscore and Ulcerative Colitis Endoscopic Index of Severity). Such a response rate is similar to that found in IBD alone. Given the possibility that PSC-IBD represents an immunologically and phenotypically distinct form of IBD from IBD alone, this finding is reassuring for clinicians considering vedolizumab to treat active IBD in patients with PSC.\\nA major limitation of this study is its retrospective nature. The use of objective outcome measures, such as liver biochemistries and endoscopic scores, serves to minimize bias; however, adverse events, particular those not leading to hospitalization, death, or LT could potentially be underreported. In addition, the absence of a comparator group, such as a placebo-treated, or matched control cohort, is a weakness that disallows attribution of causality. Finally, we did not collect information on UDCA use after baseline. Therefore, some patients might have started UDCA after starting vedolizumab, which could conceivably alter the ALP values at follow-up. Nevertheless, we separately examined the subgroup of patients not on UDCA at baseline, and observed similar changes in ALP and other liver biochemistries compared with patients taking UDCA, suggesting that we cannot attribute the observed changes to the use of UDCA.\\nIn conclusion, this large international experience of vedolizumab in patients with PSC and IBD shows that a clear-cut biochemical response to vedolizumab is not observed across the entire cohort. However, a subset of patients had a substantial drop in their ALP of 20% or more. Patients with more aggressive disease, such as the presence of cirrhosis and potentially those with a raised ALP at baseline, were more likely to respond. In addition, the proportion of patients experiencing a liver-related outcome seems to be in keeping with the natural history of disease. Furthermore, more than half of patients with IBD and PSC treated with vedolizumab had an endoscopic IBD response, similar to rates reported in IBD-only patients, and without an apparent increase in the discontinuation rate. Despite the disappointment with lack of a uniform response, further evaluation of vedolizumab as a beneficial treatment in PSC may be warranted in a subset of patients via a stratified randomized clinical trial.\\nA pro forma detailing the inclusion and exclusion criteria, baseline demographics, and necessary data for collection was sent electronically to participating centers, and data were collated centrally (by KDL). Efforts were made to collect missing data by electronic correspondence with participating centers. Patients for whom data were incomplete in respect of treatment or ALP at baseline and follow-up were excluded from the analysis. Endoscopic data were provided where available; however, the lack of endoscopic scoring for IBD before the start of vedolizumab and at last follow-up was not regarded as an exclusion criterion.\\nBaseline demographics collected included gender, age at diagnosis of PSC, type of PSC, presence of cirrhosis, type of IBD, race, and ethnicity. The presence or not of cirrhosis was determined by the treating clinician according to clinical parameters, imaging, and liver biopsy (where available). Whether vedolizumab had been discontinued was recorded, as was the reason for discontinuation (if known), the duration of vedolizumab treatment, baseline UDCA use and dose, and past use of anti–tumor necrosis factor medication.\\nClinical laboratory parameters collected at baseline and follow-up included serum ALP, ALT, AST, bilirubin and albumin, platelet count, and international normalized ratio. ALP was measured in international units per liter and calculated times the ULN. Follow-up laboratory tests were included up until LT, death, or 56 days following the final vedolizumab infusion (because this is the usual duration between maintenance infusions), whichever occurred first.\\nLiver biochemistry data (ALP, ALT, AST, and bilirubin levels) were collected at baseline, Week 6 (ie, Day 42), Week 14 (ie, Day 96), and last follow-up while on vedolizumab. The time points of Week 6 and Week 14 were used as early and medium time points to assess change in liver biochemistry because these correspond with the last induction dose of vedolizumab and the first maintenance dose time points. In clinical practice, the response of IBD to vedolizumab treatment is typically assessed after 6–10 weeks.\\nLiver biochemistry results were included up until 56 days after the final vedolizumab infusion, because 56 days is the interval between vedolizumab maintenance doses. For these time point analyses, only patient data that had paired baseline and the appropriate time point data were used. To allow for variation in clinical practice, laboratory test results from Days 30–59 could be assigned as the Week 6 value, and from Days 90–119 were used for the Week 14 value.\\nIn comparing continuous variables from baseline to a later time point, paired Student t tests or Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank tests were used according to whether the data were distributed parametrically or nonparametrically, respectively.\\nUnivariate logistic regression was carried out for the outcomes of ALP reduction ≥20% from baseline to last follow-up, ALP rise ≥20% or more from baseline to last follow-up, ALP <1.5\\xa0× ULN at last follow-up (within subgroup with baseline ALP >1.5\\xa0× ULN), the presence of liver-related outcomes, and improved endoscopic IBD response (vs worsened/unchanged). Multivariate logistic regression was carried out to assess the impact of relevant variables on ALP drop or rise by 20% or more from baseline to last follow-up. Separate univariate and multivariate logistic regression was carried out on ALP drop by 20% or more for the cohort of patients who were not also on UDCA at vedolizumab initiation, because UDCA use can lower ALP. Where there were missing covariates, a complete case analysis was carried out (Supplementary Table\\xa02).\\nThe statistical software used was GraphPad Prism version 7.0a for Mac OS X (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, www.graphpad.com), and for the univariate and multivariate analyses, R 3.5.1 Core Team (R: A language and environment for statistical computing. R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria, 2018. URL http://www.R-project.org/).\\nThe median duration of vedolizumab treatment was 412 days (IQR, 180–651; range, 37–2609), and patients were followed up with regards to clinical endpoints for a median duration of 561 days (IQR, 325–790; range, 42–2614). All patients had received a minimum of 3 infusions at the usual dosing schedule, except for 1 patient whose third infusion was slightly earlier on Day 37 rather than Day 42/Week 6. Forty-four patients (43.1%) had their vedolizumab treatment stopped during the study period. Most treatment cessation was caused by lack of efficacy (32 patients; 72.3%), with 6 (13.6%) stopping because of an adverse reaction and another 6 stopping for unknown reasons.\\nThe median duration postvedolizumab of the last follow-up laboratory measurement varied depending on the biochemistry variable. These were: ALP, 374 days (IQR, 167–579); ALT, 374 days (IQR, 166–613); AST, 438 days (IQR, 208–641); and bilirubin, 385 days (IQR, 167–637).\\nWithin the cohort of patients with cirrhosis (n\\xa0= 21) no correlation was found between change in ALP and change in other parameters of liver and organ function, such as international normalized ratio, bilirubin, and creatinine (data not shown).\\nSeparate univariate and multivariate analyses were carried out on the subgroup of patients who were not on UDCA at baseline (n\\xa0= 41; Supplementary Table\\xa04). Ten patients (24.4%) had an ALP drop ≥20%; cirrhosis again was associated with this outcome in this cohort on univariate analysis, but not on multivariate analysis.\\nGiven the previous evidence for a worse prognosis in patients whose ALP is >1.5\\xa0× ULN, we also evaluated within the subgroup of patients whose baseline ALP was >1.5\\xa0× ULN, looking at the outcome of the proportion whose ALP dropped to <1.5\\xa0× ULN at last follow-up.\\nWhen analyzing this subgroup of patients (ALP >1.5\\xa0× ULN at baseline; n\\xa0= 51) 10 (19.6%) had ALP <1.5\\xa0× ULN at last follow-up. Univariate analyses revealed that only type of IBD was associated with this outcome, with an odds ratio of 0.07 (95% confidence interval, 0.013–0.39; P\\xa0= .002) for UC as compared with CD/IBD-unspecified (Supplementary Table\\xa05).\\nSeventy-three patients had been on vedolizumab for a minimum of 6 months and had ALP data to >6 months. We analyzed this subgroup to determine if a longer duration of vedolizumab treatment had any bearing on the previously mentioned results. In this cohort, the median ALP did not change from baseline (1.65\\xa0× ULN; IQR, 0.93–3.01) to last follow-up (1.63\\xa0× ULN; IQR, 1.03–3.56; P\\xa0= .284), and a similar proportion of patients had an ALP drop ≥20% (24.7%) and ALP rise ≥20% (37.0%) compared with the overall cohort. Univariate and multivariate analyses were also similar to those of the overall cohort (data not shown).'}]}}"
