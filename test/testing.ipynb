       "    'fulltext': 'Acid-suppressive agents are widely used for the management of various upper gastrointestinal diseases, such as peptic ulcer disease (PUD), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection, artificial ulcers after gastric endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD), and Zollinger–Ellison syndrome. Histamine-2 receptor antagonists, the first class of acid-suppressive agents, have limited efficacy and poor tolerance.   Subsequently, in the late 1980s, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) were introduced into our clinical practice, which strengthened the efficacy of management of gastric acid-related disorders.   However, several gaps remained, such as insufficient inhibition of gastric acid, nocturnal acid breakthrough, poor compliance, slow onset of action, and drug efficacy by CYP2C19 gene polymorphisms. Vonoprazan, a new potassium-competitive acid blocker, has been approved for the management of acid-related diseases in Asia, South America, and some parts of North America.   It acts on the key enzyme H+/K+-ATPase in the final step of gastric acid secretion by parietal cells, thereby hindering the exchange of H+ and K+ and inhibiting gastric acid secretion.   Notably, vonoprazan has some advantages as compared to PPIs. First, its activation is independent of acidic environment. Second, its onset of action is rapid, because its peak concentration can be reached quickly after 2\\u2009h of oral administration. Third, its efficacy is not affected by meals. Fourth, it can inhibit both activated and resting proton pumps in the gastric parietal cells, and the first dose can achieve the maximum acid-suppression and maintain its stability. Its plasma elimination half-life time is 5.7–8.8\\u2009h. Fifth, it is mainly metabolized by hepatic CYP3A4/5 enzyme, but not affected by CYP2C19 gene polymorphisms. Taken together, vonoprazan seems to exert more potent and prolonged acid-suppressing effects than PPIs.   Current evidence has suggested that vonoprazan can be non-inferior to PPIs for the management of gastric acid-related disorders and more effective than PPIs for healing severe erosive esophagitis (EE) and eradicating H. pylori. Several practice guidelines have also recommended vonoprazan as the first-line choice for the management of EE and H. pylori infection. However, until now, the safety of vonoprazan has not been systematically evaluated yet. Therefore, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to elucidate the incidence and type of adverse events (AEs) in patients receiving vonoprazan, and to explore the risk factors affecting the safety of vonoprazan.\\nThis meta-analysis was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. The PRISMA checklist was shown in the Supplemental Material.\\nThis meta-analysis was registered in PROSPERO with a registration number of CRD42022314982.\\nThree major electronic databases (i.e., EMBASE, PubMed, and Cochrane Library) were searched. The following keywords were used: ‘Vonoprazan’, ‘Takecab’, and ‘TAK-438’. The last search was performed on 19 June 2022.\\nAll eligible studies should evaluate the use of vonoprazan and report its safety data. Exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) duplicates; (2) guidelines, reviews, or meta-analyses; (3) case reports, comments, notes, letters, or protocols; (4) experimental or animal studies; (5) clinical trial registration alone; (6) the study population was healthy people; (7) vonoprazan was not used; and (8) the safety data could not be extracted. Publication language was not restricted.\\nTwo researchers (WX and YS) independently extracted the following information from each included study: first author; publication year; type of publication; country; study design; enrollment period; sample size; indications for acid-suppressing agents; dose, frequency, and duration of vonoprazan, PPIs, or placebo; combined medications; total number and age range of patients taking vonoprazan, PPIs, or placebo; number of patients who experienced any AEs, drug-related AEs, serious AEs, AEs leading to drug discontinuation, and common AEs. Any AEs, drug-related AEs, serious AEs, and AEs leading to drug discontinuation are defined in accordance with the reports of each included study. Disagreement was resolved after discussion with another researcher (ZB).\\nThe Cochrane Risk of Bias tool was used for assessing the quality of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in terms of seven domains, including sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and other bias. The risk of bias is graded as ‘low risk’, ‘high risk’, and ‘uncertainty’.\\nThe Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used for assessing the quality of cohort studies. It uses a semi-quantitative system to evaluate the quality of studies in the parts of selection, comparability, exposure, and outcomes. A total of nine stars is the highest score. A NOS score of 0–3, 4–6, and 7–9 represents low, moderate, and high quality, respectively.\\nThe Johanna Briggs Institute Scale was used for assessing the quality of single-arm studies.   It includes 10 questions addressing the internal validity and risk of bias of case series, particularly confounding, selection, and information bias, in addition to the importance of clear reporting. If a study had a score of ⩽4, 5–6, and ⩾7, it would be of low, moderate, and high quality, respectively.\\nThe primary outcome of this meta-analysis was the incidence of AEs, including any AEs, drug-related AEs, serious AEs, AEs leading to drug discontinuation, and common AEs, in patients taking vonoprazan.\\nThe secondary outcome was the difference in the incidence of AEs between patients taking vonoprazan versus those taking PPIs.\\nMeta-analyses were performed using Stata software version 12.0 (Stata Corp, College Station, TX, USA), RStudio version 4.2.0 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria), and Review Manager software version 5.4 (Cochrane Collaboration, Nordic Cochrane Centre, Copenhagen, Denmark). A random-effects model was employed. Dichotomous outcomes were expressed as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Cochrane Q test and the I2 statistics were employed to assess heterogeneity among studies, and p\\u2009<\\u20090.1 or I2\\u2009>\\u200950% was considered as statistically significant heterogeneity. Publication bias was evaluated with the Eggers’ test, and p\\u2009<\\u20090.1 was considered as significant publication bias. Meta-regression analyses were employed to explore the sources of heterogeneity according to the pre-specified covariates, which included type of publication (Full-text versus Abstract versus Unpublished), study design (RCT versus non-RCT), sample size (>200 versus ⩽200), indications for vonoprazan (H. pylori infection versus GERD versus PUD versus Artificial ulcers after gastric ESD), duration of vonoprazan (>8\\u2009weeks versus ⩽8\\u2009weeks), ethnicity (Asian versus non-Asian), and age group (Adult versus Adolescent). If the number of included studies was ⩾2, subgroup analyses would be conducted according to the covariates mentioned above. In addition, we performed further subgroup analyses according to the duration of vonoprazan for the management of EE (short-term healing versus long-term maintenance) and PUD (short-term healing versus long-term prevention). p\\u2009<\\u20090.1 was considered as statistically significant interaction.\\nInitially, 1514 papers were identified. Finally, 77 studies were included (Figure 1). The characteristics of included studies were listed in Table 1. These included studies which were published between 2015 and 2022. Seventy-four studies were conducted in Asia, and three in non-Asian countries. Thirty-four studies were RCTs, 24 cohort studies, and 19 single-arm studies. The indications for vonoprazan included H. pylori infection (n\\u2009=\\u200949), GERD (n\\u2009=\\u200918), PUD (n\\u2009=\\u20096), and artificial ulcers after gastric ESD (n\\u2009=\\u20094). The sample size ranged from 12 to 2715. The duration of vonoprazan ranged from 1 to 104\\u2009weeks.\\nQuality of RCTs, cohort studies, and single-arm studies were summarized in Supplemental Figure 1, Supplemental Table 1, and Supplemental Table 2, respectively. Most of the included studies were of moderate and high quality.\\nForty-four studies explored the incidence of any AEs in patients taking vonoprazan (Figure 2(a)). The pooled incidence of any AEs was 20% (95% CI\\u2009=\\u200913–29%) with significant heterogeneity (I2\\u2009=\\u200998.9%; p\\u2009<\\u20090.01). Meta-regression analyses demonstrated that the heterogeneity might be attributed to the study design, sample size, and duration of vonoprazan (Supplemental Table 3). No significant publication bias was detected (p\\u2009=\\u20090.483).\\nEight of the 44 studies reported the severity of any AEs. The pooled incidences of mild, moderate, and severe AEs were 86, 11, and 2%, respectively (Figure 2(a)).\\nIn subgroup analyses, the pooled incidence of any AEs was 17, 20, 47, and 2% in patients taking vonoprazan for the management of H. pylori infection, GERD, PUD, and artificial ulcers after gastric ESD, respectively (pinteraction\\u2009<\\u20090.01); 40 and 68% in those for short-term healing of EE and long-term maintenance of healed EE, respectively (pinteraction\\u2009=\\u20090.01); 30 and 85% in those for short-term healing of PUD and long-term secondary prevention of PUD, respectively (pinteraction\\u2009<\\u20090.01); 43 and 17% in those for a duration of >8\\u2009weeks and ⩽8\\u2009weeks, respectively (pinteraction\\u2009=\\u20090.04); 22 and 13% in Asian and non-Asian patients taking vonoprazan, respectively (pinteraction\\u2009=\\u20090.42); and 28 and 21% in adult and adolescent patients taking vonoprazan, respectively (pinteraction\\u2009=\\u20090.33) (Figure 2(a)).\\nThirty-one studies explored the incidence of drug-related AEs in patients taking vonoprazan (Figure 2(b)). Meta-analysis demonstrated that the pooled incidence of drug-related AEs was 7% (95% CI\\u2009=\\u20095–9%) with significant heterogeneity (I2\\u2009=\\u200988.8%; p\\u2009<\\u20090.01). Meta-regression analyses did not find any source of heterogeneity (Supplemental Table 3). No significant publication bias was detected (p\\u2009=\\u20090.987).\\nIn subgroup analyses, the pooled incidence of drug-related AEs was 10, 5, 7, and 0% in patients taking vonoprazan for the management of H. pylori infection, GERD, PUD, and artificial ulcers after gastric ESD, respectively (pinteraction\\u2009<\\u20090.01); 7 and 9% in those for short-term healing of EE and long-term maintenance of healed EE, respectively (pinteraction\\u2009=\\u20090.44); 4 and 17% in those for short-term healing of PUD and long-term secondary prevention of PUD, respectively (pinteraction\\u2009=\\u20090.01); 7 and 6% in those for a duration of >8\\u2009weeks and ⩽8\\u2009weeks, respectively (pinteraction\\u2009=\\u20090.87); and 7 and 7% in adult and adolescent patients taking vonoprazan, respectively (pinteraction\\u2009=\\u20090.83) (Figure 2(b)).\\nThirty-five studies explored the incidence of serious AEs in patients taking vonoprazan (Figure 3(a)). Meta-analysis demonstrated that the pooled incidence of serious AEs was 1% (95% CI\\u2009=\\u20090–2%) with significant heterogeneity (I2\\u2009=\\u200990.8%; p\\u2009<\\u20090.01). Meta-regression analyses demonstrated that the heterogeneity might be attributed to the indications for vonoprazan and duration of vonoprazan (Supplemental Table 3). No significant publication bias was detected (p\\u2009=\\u20090.544).\\nIn subgroup analyses, the pooled incidence of serious AEs was 0, 0, 4, and 0% in patients taking vonoprazan for the management of H. pylori infection, GERD, PUD, and artificial ulcers after gastric ESD, respectively (pinteraction\\u2009=\\u20090.07); 1 and 3% in those for short-term healing of EE and long-term maintenance of healed EE, respectively (pinteraction\\u2009=\\u20090.01); 1 and 13% in those for short-term healing of PUD and long-term secondary prevention of PUD, respectively (pinteraction\\u2009<\\u20090.01); 3 and 0% in those for a duration of >8\\u2009weeks and ⩽8\\u2009weeks, respectively (pinteraction\\u2009=\\u20090.02); 1 and 1% in Asian and non-Asian patients taking vonoprazan, respectively (pinteraction\\u2009=\\u20090.94); and 1 and 0% in adult and adolescent patients taking vonoprazan, respectively (pinteraction\\u2009<\\u20090.01) (Figure 3(a)).\\nForty-seven studies explored the incidence of AEs leading to drug discontinuation in patients taking vonoprazan (Figure 3(b)). Meta-analysis demonstrated that the pooled incidence of AEs leading to drug discontinuation was 1% (95% CI\\u2009=\\u20090–1%) with significant heterogeneity (I2\\u2009=\\u200983.0%; p\\u2009<\\u20090.01). Meta-regression analyses demonstrated that the heterogeneity might be attributed to the duration of vonoprazan (Supplemental Table 3). No significant publication bias was detected (p\\u2009=\\u20090.578).\\nIn subgroup analyses, the pooled incidence of AEs leading to drug discontinuation was 0, 2, 3, and 0% in patients taking vonoprazan for the management of H. pylori infection, GERD, PUD, and artificial ulcers after gastric ESD, respectively (pinteraction\\u2009<\\u20090.01); 2 and 6% in those for short-term healing of EE and long-term maintenance of healed EE, respectively (pinteraction\\u2009=\\u20090.02); 1 and 8% in those for short-term healing of PUD and long-term secondary prevention of PUD, respectively (pinteraction\\u2009<\\u20090.01); 5 and 0% in those for a duration of >8\\u2009weeks and ⩽8\\u2009weeks, respectively (pinteraction\\u2009<\\u20090.01); 1 and 2% in Asian and non-Asian patients taking vonoprazan, respectively (pinteraction\\u2009=\\u20090.72); and 1 and 1% in adult and adolescent patients taking vonoprazan, respectively (pinteraction\\u2009=\\u20090.13) (Figure 3(b)).\\nMeta-analyses demonstrated that increased serum gastrin level was the most common AE (19%, 95% CI\\u2009=\\u20093–44%), followed by increased pepsinogen I level (17%, 95% CI\\u2009=\\u20092–43%), nasopharyngitis (14%, 95% CI\\u2009=\\u20097–22%), bloating (9%, 95% CI\\u2009=\\u20094–15%), loose stools (8%, 95% CI\\u2009=\\u20094–15%), diarrhea (7%, 95% CI\\u2009=\\u20094–9%), heart burn (6%, 95% CI\\u2009=\\u20093–9%), abdominal pain (5%, 95% CI\\u2009=\\u20092–9%), and upper respiratory tract infection (5%, 95% CI\\u2009=\\u20093–8%) (Table 2).\\nTwenty-six studies compared the incidence of any AEs between patients taking vonoprazan versus PPIs (Supplemental Figure 2). Meta-analysis demonstrated that the incidence of any AEs was statistically similar between patients taking vonoprazan versus PPIs (OR\\u2009=\\u20090.96, 95% CI\\u2009=\\u20090.80–1.15, p\\u2009=\\u20090.66) with significant heterogeneity (I2\\u2009=\\u200969.0%; p\\u2009<\\u20090.01). Meta-regression analyses demonstrated that the heterogeneity might be attributed to the type of publication and study design (Supplemental Table 3). No significant publication bias was detected (p\\u2009=\\u20090.768).\\nTwenty studies compared the incidence of drug-related AEs between patients taking vonoprazan versus PPIs (Supplemental Figure 3). Meta-analysis demonstrated that the incidence of drug-related AEs was statistically similar between patients taking vonoprazan versus PPIs (OR\\u2009=\\u20091.10, 95% CI\\u2009=\\u20090.87–1.39, p\\u2009=\\u20090.52) with significant heterogeneity (I2\\u2009=\\u200942.0%; p\\u2009=\\u20090.04). Meta-regression analyses did not find any source of heterogeneity (Supplemental Table 3). No significant publication bias was detected (p\\u2009=\\u20090.472).\\nTwenty-one studies compared the incidence of serious AEs between patients taking vonoprazan versus PPIs (Supplemental Figure 4). Meta-analysis demonstrated that the incidence of serious AEs was statistically similar between patients taking vonoprazan versus PPIs (OR\\u2009=\\u20091.14, 95% CI\\u2009=\\u20090.87–1.49, p\\u2009=\\u20090.36). There was no statistically significant heterogeneity (I2\\u2009=\\u20090.0%; p\\u2009=\\u20090.93). No significant publication bias was detected (p\\u2009=\\u20090.579).\\nThirty-one studies compared the incidence of AEs leading to drug discontinuation between patients taking vonoprazan versus PPIs (Supplemental Figure 5). Meta-analysis demonstrated that the incidence of AEs leading to drug discontinuation was statistically similar between patients taking vonoprazan versus PPIs (OR\\u2009=\\u20091.09, 95% CI\\u2009=\\u20090.82–1.45, p\\u2009=\\u20090.55).

No significant publication bias was detected (p\\u2009=\\u20090.395).\\nMeta-analyses demonstrated that the incidences of increased serum gastrin (OR\\u2009=\\u20096.25, 95% CI\\u2009=\\u20094.08–9.59, p\\u2009<\\u20090.01) and pepsinogen I levels (OR\\u2009=\\u20093.49, 95% CI\\u2009=\\u20092.40–5.10, p\\u2009<\\u20090.01) were significantly higher in patients taking vonoprazan than those taking PPIs. There was no statistically significant heterogeneity (I2\\u2009=\\u20090%; p\\u2009=\\u20090.45 and I2\\u2009=\\u20090%; p\\u2009=\\u20090.66, respectively). The incidence of diarrhea was significantly lower in patients taking vonoprazan than those taking PPIs (OR\\u2009=\\u20090.73, 95% CI\\u2009=\\u20090.57–0.94, p\\u2009=\\u20090.32) with significant heterogeneity (I2\\u2009=\\u200957.7%; p\\u2009<\\u20090.01). The incidences of other common AEs were statistically similar between patients taking vonoprazan and PPIs (Figure 4).\\nOur study has systematically reviewed the currently available evidence regarding the safety profile of vonoprazan, and found that the pooled incidences of any AEs, drug-related AEs, serious AEs, and AEs leading to drug discontinuation were 20, 7, 1, and 1%, respectively; nearly all the reported AEs were mild; and its safety was similar to that of PPIs.\\nOur meta-analysis has some features as compared to previous ones, as follows. First, previous meta-analyses explored the safety of vonoprazan for a certain indication. By comparison, our meta-analysis more comprehensively evaluated the safety of vonoprazan across multiple indications, including H. pylori infection, GERD, PUD, and artificial ulcers after gastric ESD. Second, previous meta-analyses only explored AEs leading to drug discontinuation and/or any AEs. By comparison, our meta-analyses also evaluated drug-related and serious AEs. Third, our meta-analysis, but not previous meta-analyses, evaluated a broader spectrum of common AEs and various severity of any AEs in patients taking vonoprazan.\\nDue to the lack of relevant data, we were not able to directly analyze the risk factors affecting the safety of vonoprazan. However, we performed subgroup analyses to evaluate the incidence of AEs in patients taking vonoprazan according to various conditions. First, patients with PUD had higher incidences of any AEs, serious AEs, and AEs leading to drug discontinuation than those with GERD, H. pylori infection, and artificial ulcer after gastric ESD. This might be because PUD is more complex and severe than other disease conditions, and requires a longer duration of vonoprazan.   Specifically, we included both studies regarding short-term healing of PUD and long-term secondary prevention of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or aspirin-induced PUD into the same subgroup. In short-term healing of PUD studies, some patients with PUD had concomitant H. pylori infection which needs to be eradicated by vonoprazan combined with other drugs. In long-term secondary prevention of PUD studies, patients required a longer duration of vonoprazan. Second, patients with H. pylori infection had a higher incidence of drug-related AEs than those with PUD, GERD, and artificial ulcer after gastric ESD. This was mainly because multiple drugs, including antibiotics, bismuth, and probiotics, should be added along with vonoprazan for H. pylori eradication. Third, it is readily understood that the incidence of AEs was higher in patients taking long-term (>8\\u2009weeks) use of vonoprazan than those taking short-term (⩽8\\u2009weeks) use of vonoprazan. This finding was also observed in patients taking vonoprazan for the management of EE and PUD. Fourth, the race of the population taking vonoprazan (i.e., Asian and non-Asian) might not influence the risk of AEs. Recently, a population pharmacokinetic model evaluated the impact of the population from Asia and Europe on vonoprazan exposure, and also showed that the population effect on vonoprazan exposure was limited.   Fifth, the incidence of AEs also seemed to be similar between adult and adolescent patients taking vonoprazan, which suggested that vonoprazan can be safe and well tolerated in both adults and adolescents. However, this finding required further validation in adolescents.\\nIncreased serum gastrin and pepsinogen I levels might be the most common AEs, and their incidences were significantly higher in patients taking vonoprazan than those taking PPIs. They are believed to be a consequence of the potent gastric acid antisecretory effect of vonoprazan,   which is similar to PPIs, but they do not cause any harmful effects on gastric mucosa. The VISION trial evaluated the effect of vonoprazan on gastric mucosal tissue and its long-term safety. The four-year interim analysis found significantly higher levels of serum gastrin and pepsinogen I in the vonoprazan group than the lansoprazole group. Additionally, a case of foveolar-type adenoma developed in the vonoprazan group, and a case of oxyntic gland adenoma in the lansoprazole group. Histologically, hyperplasia of parietal cells and G cells was more frequently detected in the vonoprazan group. There was no neoplastic proliferation of endocrine cells in either group.   However, a case of foveolar-type gastric adenocarcinoma has recently been reported in a male patient with EE after a 156-week maintenance therapy of vonoprazan 10\\u2009mg daily.   In addition, gastric mucosal redness, ‘stardust gastric mucosa’, and white globe appearance can be observed in patients taking vonoprazan, but they are not of major clinical significance. Other common AEs were infrequent, and their incidences were similar to that of PPIs.\\nIt has been reported that long-term use of PPIs may also lead to clostridium difficile infection, osteoporosis, vitamin B12 deficiency, hypomagnesemia, and fundic gland polyp,   but they have never been found in our meta-analysis. Certainly, such AEs in patients receiving long-term use of vonoprazan deserves further observations.\\nPPIs exposure is associated with increased risk of infection, decompensation, and death in cirrhosis and that of progression to renal insufficiency in chronic kidney disease. However, to date, no studies have reported that vonoprazan would cause such AEs. Indeed, patients with cirrhosis and chronic kidney disease were often excluded from our included studies, failing to evaluate the safety of vonoprazan in such patients. In future, prospective studies are needed to evaluate the safety of vonoprazan in patients with cirrhosis and chronic kidney diseases.\\nOur meta-analysis has some limitations as follows. First, a proportion of included studies were single-arm without control groups. Second, 18 studies were published as abstracts and 2 were unpublished clinical trials. Third, these included studies were mainly conducted in Japan. Fourth, we did not clearly discriminate which AEs were caused by PPIs/vonoprazan or antibiotics during H. pylori eradication therapy. Fifth, the heterogeneity among studies was statistically significant in most of our meta-analyses. Sixth, combined medication and underlying comorbidities, which might influence the safety of vonoprazan, could not be sufficiently evaluated in subgroup analyses.\\nBased on the current systematic review and meta-analysis, vonoprazan often has similar safety compared to PPIs, and rarely causes serious AEs and drug discontinuation. It seems that vonoprazan has a favorable safety profile in adolescent patients and non-Asian population. Furthermore, the safety of vonoprazan may be influenced by its indications and duration. However, more high-quality studies are necessary in future to validate these findings and to explore the risk factors affecting the safety of vonoprazan.'},\n",

       "    'fulltext': 'Since its initial discovery, H. pylori became the most intensively characterized microbial pathogen, mainly because of the unique infection site, the link to severe gastric diseases, and the extraordinary overall prevalence rate, as it is estimated to affect 50% of the world’s population. H. pylori, a gram-negative, microaerophilic, and extremophile microorganism, causes serious gastric disorders, such as gastric atrophy, peptic ulcer disease (PUD), gastric adenocarcinoma, and gastric cell lymphoma (mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue, MALT), which renders H. pylori the only bacterial pathogen which is classified as a class I carcinogen. H. pylori possesses a wide array of virulence factors that assist in establishing a continuous infection and ascertain bacterial survival under acidic conditions in the stomach. As infected individuals can remain symptomless over long periods, prevalence rates are most likely underdiagnosed—in particular, in developing countries with relatively poor public health infrastructure. It is noteworthy that, albeit infection rates are seemingly extremely high, only a small fraction (less than 1%) of infected individuals develop severe gastric complications. Nevertheless, the high incidence of H. pylori infections suggests an increasing burden on public health care, especially in developing countries where infections during early childhood appear to occur more frequently than in developed countries. In South-East Asian countries, gastric cancer is often diagnosed in the advanced stages of the disease with a poor prognosis for 5-year survival. Considerable differences in H. pylori prevalence are observed for different regions of the world, and the large variations in prevalence have been attributed to dietary behavior, water quality, and socioeconomic conditions. \\nGiven the fact that H. pylori represents the primary risk factor for gastric cancer (GC) and the cause of cancer-related death, immense resources are currently dedicated to the treatment and eradication of H. pylori infections. For decades, a triple therapy—consisting of a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI: omeprazole, pantoprazole) and 2 antibiotics (usually clarithromycin combined with either metronidazole, a synthetic nitroimidazole, or ampicillin)—served as first-line therapy. As resistance rates to clarithromycin and metronidazole increased to unacceptable levels, clarithromycin-resistant H. pylori was included by the WHO, in 2017, in the list of high-priority, antibiotic-resistant bacteria (Figure 1). The triple therapy is now progressively being replaced in areas of high clarithromycin resistance rates by a bismuth-containing, “three-in-one”, quadruple therapy (BQT).\\nThe excessive use of antibiotics for the chemotherapy of H. pylori infections has inevitably created a situation in which resistance development exceeded alarming levels and extensively compromised the usefulness of these antibiotics for the eradication of H. pylori. The declined efficacy has now incited intensive efforts for the discovery not only of novel antimicrobial compounds but also for the development of innovative regimens for treatment. Despite rapid economic growth over the past decades, countries in Asia still face a deteriorating situation of H. pylori infections. On the other hand, there has been tremendous progress made in this region with research efforts aimed at better control of H. pylori-related diseases that have resulted in an impressive and ever-increasing number of publications.\\nThis review aims to present a condensed view of current progress in the field from an Asian perspective with a view of resistance mechanisms and strategies to surmount them. For a comprehensive overview, the reader is directed to several excellent reviews summarizing key aspects and current challenges of H. pylori antimicrobial therapy. We apologize to authors whose work we have failed to cite owing to space constraints.\\nEradication strategies for H. pylori infections are currently being massively challenged by increasing antibiotic resistance, which can ultimately result in treatment failure and unclear therapeutic outcomes. Strains of H. pylori can exhibit considerable resistance to the most widely used antimicrobial drugs: clarithromycin, levofloxacin, metronidazole, amoxicillin, and tetracycline (Figure 2). The antibiotic resistance of H. pylori is commonly assessed using the epsilometer test (E-test), a commercially available, culture-based method using a predefined gradient of antibiotic concentrations on a plastic strip to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of antibiotics. The European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) has issued a recommendation to consider MIC values > 0.5 mg/L for clarithromycin and >8 mg/L for metronidazole as indicators of H. pylori strain resistance. However, it should be noted that MICs for resistant strains can display considerable variations between 0.5 to 256 mg/L for clarithromycin and 0.8 to 8 mg/L for metronidazole. Marked geographic differences are also observed for resistance rates to specific antibiotics. While in Brazil and Germany, resistance rates to clarithromycin were 28.7% and 23.2%, respectively, they were only 7.3% in Iran and 0% in Malaysia. Earlier data for H. pylori antibiotic resistance and resistance trends over a 6-year period of surveillance can be found in Ghotaslou et al..\\nA survey among 9 ASEAN countries (Thailand, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, and Vietnam) was conducted to evaluate the prevalence of infection and resistance rates against metronidazole, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin. H. pylori prevalence can vary considerably, ranging from 20% in Malaysia, 21–54% in Thailand, and 69% in Myanmar, while resistance to clarithromycin was highest in Cambodia (43%) and lowest in the Philippines (2%) and Myanmar (0%); however, data for the latter may reflect inadequate surveillance of resistance due to poor public health infrastructures. It is further mentioned that, at the time of the survey in Laos and Cambodia, culture-based methods for susceptibility testing were not available. Resistance to metronidazole is relatively common, whereas resistance to amoxicillin was found to be rare. The wide range of resistance rates between the different countries has urged the need for susceptibility testing prior to treatment. Current prevalence and antibiotic resistance patterns were analyzed in a 4-year retrospective study conducted from 2013 to 2017 at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital in Thailand. Overall, 92.61% of 1258 patients responded to initial treatment, while the remaining 95 patients responded to second-line treatment with higher doses or different antibiotics. H. pylori strains with resistance to ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, and clarithromycin were observed at rates of 21.43, 14.29, and 10.71%, respectively, whereas no strains resistant to amoxicillin, tetracycline, or levofloxacin were found. An interesting observation by the authors even suggested declining resistance rates for amoxicillin, metronidazole, levofloxacin, and tetracycline.\\nMutational changes leading to genetically modified drug targets appear to represent the most common type of resistance mechanism. Nevertheless, it appears that mutations affecting membrane permeability, biofilm development, and efflux pump systems are becoming more and more significant for the manifestation of drug-resistant genotypes.\\nAmoxicillin has been used as a standard drug for the treatment of H. pylori infections for decades and was initially considered “resistance-resistant” since very few examples of strain resistance had been discovered by then. Later, it turned out that high rates of resistance (49.5 to 72.7%) to amoxicillin can frequently arise, in particular, as a result of unsuccessful eradication attempts. Resistance to amoxicillin occurs predominantly through mutations in the PBP gene and changes in membrane permeability. Primary resistance rates for amoxicillin (3 to 5%) are relatively small, and they are considerably lower than those for metronidazole and clarithromycin. Nevertheless, resistance to amoxicillin was identified as an independent risk factor for treatment failure of the standard triple therapy at different breakpoints. Resistance rates were estimated to be approximately 11% at a breakpoint MIC > 0.125 mg /L. It was speculated that increased rates of amoxicillin resistance correlate with the unregulated use of the antibiotic in Asia and Southern America, where amoxicillin is available without prescription.\\nH. pylori strains resistant to clarithromycin, an inhibitor of bacterial protein biosynthesis, usually carry point mutations in the 23S rRNA of the 50S ribosomal subunit. A recent study conducted at Peking University has identified genetic determinants of antibiotic resistance against clarithromycin and levofloxacin through high-throughput nucleotide sequencing. Mutation sites related to clarithromycin were identified as peptidyl transferase in the V domain of 23S rRNA, while gyrA, a member of the DNA topoisomerase type II family, was related to levofloxacin resistance. The most common mutant sites in clarithromycin-resistant gene sequences were A2143G and A2142G. The most frequent levofloxacin resistance mutations were N87K, D91N, and D91G. A fraction (13.5%) of the investigated isolates had double resistance mutations for both clarithromycin and levofloxacin.\\nAside from the A2142G and A2143G mutations, a study recently performed in Sudan revealed the existence of a T2182C mutation within the V domain of the 23S rRNA gene. The authors did not observe any associations of 23S rRNA point mutations with gender, age group, or patients’ geographical location. However, the number of sequenced samples (25) was relatively small. The screening of 169 patients positive for chronic gastritis in Vietnam, using PCR-RFLP, found the A2143G mutation in 36.1% of samples and the A2142G mutation in 3.6%; however, it failed to detect the A2142C mutation.\\nA novel levofloxacin-resistance mutation in gyrA, consisting of the insertion of five amino acid residues (QDNSV) immediately after the start codon, and a substitution mutation at R295H were identified through the whole-genome level sequencing of 38 clinical isolates from patients in Karnataka, India who had been diagnosed with gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, or intestinal metaplasia. The authors concluded that, in light of these results, even moderate resistance to metronidazole and levofloxacin could lead to treatment failure; therefore, they have proposed a triple therapy utilizing amoxicillin, tetracycline, and PPI as an alternative first-line treatment regime. Double mutations (N87T, D91N) and single mutations (N87I and N87T) were identified in the gyrA gene of isolates obtained from the gastroesophageal mucosa, whereby the N87I mutation produced high resistance to levofloxacin at a MIC ≥ 32 μg/mL. Mutations in the gyrB gene seem to occur rarely, and the mutation S479G and at position 463 were recently identified.\\nAn important mechanism of H. pylori drug resistance is the reduction of drug influx by structural modifications of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) membrane component. The recently described rfaF gene (previously waaF) functions as heptose transferase in the LPS core biosynthesis pathway, whereby mutations are conducive to the “deep coarse lipopolysaccharide” phenotype, which decreases the drug-permeability of the cell membrane. This phenotype produces strains that are cross-resistant to amoxicillin, tetracycline, and clarithromycin, whereas only marginal resistance to chloramphenicol was associated with this phenotype. It was observed that the rfaF gene of drug-resistant clinical strains displayed high mutation rates, with the K331R mutation being the most frequent (44.44%), a finding which makes the rfaA-encoded enzyme a promising candidate for evaluation as a potential drug target.\\nUpregulated efflux pump activity, owing to an increased expression of tolC homologous genes (hefA), was characterized using real-time PCR with clarithromycin- and metronidazole-resistant strains isolated from patients with gastroduodenal disorders in Iran. A small portion (9.5%) of the investigated strains were multidrug-resistant H. pylori (MDR) strains with resistance against metronidazole and clarithromycin. A sequence analysis of the rdxA and frxA genes of the metronidazole-resistant strains and the 23S rRNA for the clarithromycin-resistant strains was performed to determine the genetic modifications leading to drug resistance. The most frequently occurring mutations were within the rdxA gene (85.5%) and the A2143G point mutation in the 23S rRNA (63.1%). Both mutations were also present in the MDR strains. The rdxA gene encodes an oxygen-insensitive, NADPH-dependent nitroreductase, which was associated with metronidazole resistance in earlier reports. It was proposed that mutational inactivation of rdxA and other reductase-encoding genes, such as frxA (encoding a NAD(P)H-flavin oxidoreductase) and fdxB (ferredoxin-like protein), would be favorable to the formation of the resistant phenotype. H. pylori strains resistant to metronidazole and levofloxacin, analyzed using whole-genome sequencing, were shown to express non-functional or altered RdxA and/or FrxA proteins resulting from nonsense or frameshift mutations in the coding sequences and containing partial gene deletions. However, the function of the rdxA gene product, as well as the related frxA gene, is still subject to debate. Allelic replacement of wild-type rdxA with truncated rdxA resulted in metronidazole resistance, whereas replacement with missense-mutated rdxA did not result in detectable resistance. It was suggested that resistance to metronidazole can arise in H. pylori without mutations in rdxA or frxA, thus supporting the notion that other genetic elements are likely involved in metronidazole resistance, a finding corroborated by a recent report demonstrating that metronidazole-resistant strains can carry intact genes for both oxidoreductases. It is noteworthy that, mainly because of the accelerating resistance development attributed to high prescription rates, fluoroquinolones are now infrequently used as first-line treatment drugs for H. pylori infections; however, they still may have some effectiveness as second-line drugs.\\nSeveral observations in the literature suggest a relationship between specific genotypes for virulence factors and the degree of gastroduodenal diseases. The absence of the cagA genotype was proposed to be linked to the development of metronidazole resistance. VacA is an important virulence factor with pleiotropic effects involved in gastric mucosa colonization and disease progression. The vacA gene encodes several polymorphic regions (s, m, i), and clarithromycin resistance was significantly linked to the vacA i-allele, whereby the clarithromycin-resistance mutation, A2142G, was 3-fold more frequent in vacA i1 strains than vacA i2 strains. Resistance to clarithromycin, metronidazole, and amoxicillin was found to be increased in strains harboring cagE and vacA s1a/m2 genotypes. Wang et al. have attempted to correlate resistance to the five most commonly used antibiotics (metronidazole, levofloxacin, clarithromycin, amoxicillin, and tetracycline) to the presence of genes encoding virulence factors. Clarithromycin resistance was associated with iceA, while resistance to metronidazole was related to vacA; levofloxacin resistance was concerned with cagA and slyD, and amoxicillin resistance was associated with iceA.\\nEradication confirmation 4–6 weeks post-treatment is commonly used to assess the success of the therapeutic efforts. Failure of initial treatment can occur in up to 20% of patients, and while patient-specific factors may play a role to some extent, major complications and, in particular, re-infection can arise due to poor medication compliance. For this situation, salvage therapies have been developed that renounce the use of first-line antibiotics, especially clarithromycin and metronidazole. Instead, bismuth quadruple therapy (BQT) using a PPI, bismuth subcitrate or subsalicylate, amoxicillin, and tetracycline or levofloxacin triple therapy (PPI, levofloxacin, and amoxicillin) are frequently considered as alternative treatment options. Regional antibiotic resistance profiles can be analyzed using molecular susceptibility testing, which improves treatment success rates.\\nRifabutin-based triple therapy has recently emerged as a promising alternative to conventional treatment with clarithromycin and metronidazole. H. pylori is highly susceptible to rifabutin, a derivative of rifamycin and an inhibitor of the prokaryotic RNA polymerase. Marketed under the brand name ‘Talicia’, the therapy consists of two antibiotics, amoxicillin and rifabutin, and the PPI omeprazole. In patients with confirmed adherence to treatment, eradication rates can be as high as 90%, and reported resistance development has been minimal when compared to standard drugs.\\nA therapeutic regimen designated as LOAD (levofloxacin, omeprazole, Alinia, and doxycycline) has gained some attention as a second-line therapy, especially in cases of BQT failure. Alinia is the brand name for nitazoxanide, which was originally discovered as a broad-spectrum antiparasitic drug. However, the antimicrobial activity spectrum resembles that of metronidazole, making this drug a potential alternative to metronidazole in H. pylori eradication regimens. Three enzymes, including a pyruvate oxidoreductase, were identified as mediators of susceptibility to nitazoxanide in H. pylori strains. Notably, no clinically significant levels of resistance were observed during clinical studies or during long-term in vitro exposure of H. pylori strains to the drug.\\nA modification of the quadruple therapy, comprised of furazolidone, amoxicillin, bismuth, and a PPI, was recently explored in a clinical setting. Furazolidone is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor and nitrofurantoin-type antibiotic commonly used in Asia. The furazolidone-based therapy demonstrated high eradication rates, exceeding 90%, and was found to be suitable as a first-line treatment for H. pylori infection in areas with a high prevalence of clarithromycin resistance. The clinical usefulness of this therapy was further supported by the fact that adverse effects were mild and occurred at a low incidence.\\nWhile not an antibiotic by itself, the antisecretory drug vonoprazan (Takecab) a potassium-competitive acid blocker (P-CAP), has emerged as an acid-suppressing agent with a much higher (~350-fold) potency than standard PPIs. Unlike conventional PPIs, vonoprazan is a reversible H+-K+ ATPase inhibitor. Eradication rates >90% were observed in a study of patients receiving triple therapy with vonoprazan, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin or metronidazole. It is, therefore, conceivable that vonoprazan could contribute to conquering the increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistance associated with treatment regimens including conventional PPIs for the eradication of H. pylori infections.\\nThe identification of mutations conducive to resistance genotypes using clinical biopsy specimens would ideally represent a strategy for clinicians to find and adjust efficient treatment options. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing allows for the identification of resistant strains of H. pylori and excludes the use of ineffective antibiotics, especially in regions with high antibiotic resistance. In addition to standard bacterial culture methods, rapid, culture-independent molecular assay formats exist that allow for the identification of resistance mutations and the assessment of the efficacy of the intended therapy. These include the PCR-RFLP detection of point mutations, droplet digital PCR, the amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS-PCR), and test kits, such as GenoType® HelicoDR (Hain Lifescience GmbH, Nehren, Germany), which allow for the simultaneous detection of resistance mutations to clarithromycin and fluoroquinolones. Dual-priming, oligonucleotide-based multiplex polymerase chain reaction (DPO-PCR) has been used in tailored first-line therapies in South Korea with satisfactory results.\\nThe disadvantage of these procedures is the requirement of primers, fluorescent probes, and specialized equipment that is not available in most clinical settings. It is also noteworthy that, whereas two prominent sites of mutation in the 23S rRNA are recognized for clarithromycin resistance, metronidazole resistance involves several mutations in rdxA and other genes that are more difficult to detect.\\nThe tailored therapy has demonstrated its practical usefulness, particularly in cases of second-line or third-line refractory infections in combination with PCR-based molecular tests. The surveillance of strain resistance using susceptibility testing can now be carried out with stool samples, thus obviating the need for invasive methods, such as endoscopy (stool polymerase chain reaction). \\nOf particular interest is the question of whether the detection of a resistant genotype is concurrently correlated with the existence of a drug-resistant phenotype. Zhang et al. have compared the results of ARMS-PCR to the E-test MIC drug sensitivity assay for clarithromycin and reported a statistically significant correlation (p > 0.05, area under the receiver operating curve = 0.969) between the two methods. However, some strains, tested as wild-type using ARMS-PCR, appeared to be drug-resistant, thus suggesting that the clarithromycin-resistant phenotypes may not be limited to sites 2142 and 2143, but may carry mutations at different positions.\\nIncreasing resistance rates observed for the most commonly used antibiotics against H. pylori infections have now stimulated intensive efforts to discover novel antimicrobial compounds and leads that are useful for structure-based drug design. The conventional, alternative, and novel treatment options for H. pylori are summarized in Table 1.\\nA recent study from China has described the potent antimicrobial activities of armeniaspirol A (ARM1) against MDR strains of H. pylori. Armeniaspirols are antibiotics containing an unusual spiro(4.4)non-8-ene moiety bio-synthesized by Streptomyces armeniacus. The compound has membrane-disrupting properties, which ultimately lead to an inhibition of biofilm formation. Remarkably, dual therapy with ARM1 and omeprazole demonstrated bactericidal effects comparable to the standard triple therapy in a mouse model of MDR H. pylori strains, while concurrent toxicity against normal tissues was found to be negligible. The bactericidal activity of ARM1 appeared to be significantly higher than that of metronidazole. Similar to armeniaspirol, the natural herb compound dihydrotanshinone I (DHT) also exhibited antibacterial activity through the elimination of preformed biofilms and biofilm-encased H. pylori cells. DHT showed strong time-dependent bactericidal activity, with MIC50/90 values of 0.25/0.5 µg/mL.\\nA promising opportunity for pharmacological intervention is the inhibition of the response stimulator HsrA, an electron-transfer flavodoxin protein that is essential for numerous metabolic functions. A screening of 1120 compounds contained in an FDA drug library resulted in the identification of seven natural flavonoids that inhibited the DNA-binding activity of HsrA. Phytochemicals, chrysin, and galangin exhibited marked synergistic bactericidal activity in combination with clarithromycin or metronidazole. Investigations of flavodoxin inhibitors have also been extended to the evaluation of novel synthetic nitroethylene- and 7-nitrobenzoxadiazole-based inhibitors of H. pylori flavodoxin, showing promising therapeutic indexes. Oral administration to a mice model of H. pylori infection revealed low toxicity and decreased rates of gastric colonization. However, at present, detrimental effects on the gut microbiota remain to be investigated in greater detail.\\nCurcumin (diferuloylmethane) and polyphenolic plant metabolites display a multitude of anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory, and anti-proliferative properties and are currently being explored as potential therapeutic candidates against H. pylori. Curcumin has not only demonstrated pronounced antimicrobial effects in H. pylori infected C57BL/6 mice but also seems to contribute to the reduction or repair of gastric epithelium damage, as revealed by histological analysis. The cytotoxin-associated gene A protein (CagA) is involved in the establishment of a persistent H. pylori infection, the malignant transformation of gastric cells, and consequently, is a major factor in the development of gastric cancer. The interaction of CagA with curcumin and its metabolites has been proposed to contribute to the suppression of CagA oncogenic activity. It is important to note that curcumin failed, in a large number of studies, to demonstrate clinically useful effects; nevertheless, the possibility exists that despite their low solubility and poor adsorption and bioavailability, optimized derivatives of curcumin, such as EF24, may prove useful as supplementary agents for the treatment of H. pylori infections.\\nAntimicrobial peptides (AMPs) with activity against drug-resistant H. pylori were recently identified in an Iranian study through a screening of PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases. Nine groups containing 22 antimicrobial peptides were comprised of pexiganan, tilapia piscidin, epinecidin-1, cathelicidins, defensins, bicarinalin, odorranain-HP, PGLa-AM1, and bacteriocins—whereby the highest anti-H. pylori activities were observed for pexiganan, tilapia piscidin, and PGLa-AM1. The latter represents five kDa peptides with a predominant α-helical structure, cationic charge, and high isoelectric points. The 22-amino-acid residue peptide, pexiganan, which is a magainin AMP analog, was incorporated into chitosan-alginate polyelectrolyte complex pexiganan nanoparticles (PNPs) with a particle size of 415 ± 26 nm for enhanced delivery of the AMP to the gastric mucosa. The results confirmed that PNPs efficiently eradicated H. pylori in the mouse stomach and showed improved peptide stability and prolonged retention times. Moreover, the strategy of mucoadhesive delivery of nano- or microparticles offers the benefit of effective drug penetration across the mucus layer, increased resistance against proteolytic degradation, and would also protect acid-sensitive drugs from fast degradation.\\nWhile the use of genetically engineered symbiotic lactic acid bacteria as carriers for AMP delivery may constitute a future treatment option for H. pylori, probiotics were intensively studied as part of H. pylori treatment regimens. Probiotics display a wide range of antibacterial effects, including the secretion of organic acids and bacteriocins, the formation of H2O2, the inhibition of adhesion processes, and the downregulation of proinflammatory factor expression.\\nThe results of earlier studies suggest that specific probiotics, such as Saccharomyces boulardii and Lactobacillus johnsonni La1, probably diminish the bacterial load, but do not completely eradicate the H. pylori bacteria when administered as monotherapy. Adjuvant therapy, employing combinations of probiotics and antibiotics, appears to be more effective, as the probiotics contribute significantly to diminishing the iatrogenic side effects of the drug treatment. Inhibitory effects on H. pylori growth and a significant reduction in antibiotic-associated side effects were observed with the novel preparation of Lactobacillus reuteri. Lactobacillus reuteri synthesizes a non-peptidic antipathogen compound, reuterin, reported to downregulate the genes for virulence factors vacA and flaA. These findings have confirmed various beneficial effects of probiotics not only for H. pylori infections but also for several other gastrointestinal diseases.\\nHerbal therapy for gastric diseases has a long history of demonstrated gastroprotective and antimicrobial effects in H. pylori infections. Therapeutic strategies for the effective treatment of H. pylori infections are now being broadly augmented through increasing research efforts aimed at the clinical evaluation of herbal and traditional Chinese medicine. An overview of the rapidly expanding field is presented by Li Y et al.. The current knowledge about phytomedicines used for H. pylori-associated gastric diseases is summarized by Salehi et al.. Innovative solutions to overcome current treatment deficits, such as resistance, could conceivably arise from integrated Chinese and Western medicine. Aside from their use as an herbal cure, per se, phytochemicals that have been identified in numerous studies may offer prospects for the discovery of lead compounds for the design of novel and synthetic therapeutic agents.\\nThe emergence of the antimicrobial resistance of H. pylori to important antibiotics keeps increasing, and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is risky if it leads to treatment failure clinically and (gastroduodenal) histopathologically. However, there have been no previous reports specifying clinical status (e.g., higher prevalence rates of peptic ulcer, carcinoma, or lymphoma) if there is treatment failure due to antimicrobial resistance. The previous reports have only mentioned that antimicrobial resistance was associated with treatment failure. In individual patients, mechanisms of resistance deployed by H. pylori cause treatment failures, diagnostic difficulties, and ambiguity in the clinical interpretation of therapeutic outcomes. At the population scale, globally increasing antibiotic resistance has led to a substantial decrease in efficacy of H. pylori treatment and probably an increased risk of complications, such as peptic ulcers and gastric cancer. This resistance becomes more important in areas or countries where H. pylori has high resistance or multi-resistance to the antibiotics used in treatment regimens. Since the regimens may have a high risk of clinical or histopathological treatment failure, the drug sensitivity of H. pylori should be regularly reported in highly antibiotic-resistant countries. As a result, WHO has declared that AMR is a global health and development threat. It requires urgent multisectoral action in order to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\\nTaken together, intensive research efforts and the development of novel and enhanced therapeutic options in the ‘post-antibiotic’ era have generated promising alternatives and treatment strategies to combat infections with drug-resistant H. pylori.\\nThe deteriorating problem of antibiotic-resistant H. pylori is now being targeted by a multitude of research efforts aimed at understanding the molecular mechanisms of resistance and the development of novel and alternative options for treatment. Research in Asian countries has greatly contributed to the wealth of data accumulated over the previous years. Much progress has been made in the molecular analysis of genetic alterations leading to drug resistance, in particular, for the frequently applied antibiotics clarithromycin and metronidazole. Culture-independent molecular methods now allow for the implementation of susceptibility-guided therapies adapted to local resistance profiles, with a largely reduced risk of treatment failure. Efficient rescue therapies using less resistance-prone, second-line drugs, such as rifabutin, amoxicillin, and furazolidone, can be used to achieve high eradication rates. Screening for novel antimicrobial compounds has identified promising candidates for drug development, such as flavodoxin inhibitors, antimicrobial peptides, antibiotics, and phytochemicals traditionally used in Chinese medicine, which warrant further investigation. It can be concluded that, despite the clinical challenges, gastrointestinal diseases caused by H. pylori can, at large, be efficiently managed using appropriate diagnostic tools, improved regimens for treatment, and post-treatment confirmation of eradication.\\nConceptualization, M.S., P.W. and G.K.; data curation, M.S., P.W., G.K., J.B.R., N.K. and T.D.; writing—review and editing, M.S., P.W., G.K., J.B.R., N.K. and T.D.

       "    'fulltext': 'New drug approvals in the US were down in 2022, by about 25% — to the lowest level since 2016. Innovation hasn’t slowed, though: new modalities such as antibody–drug conjugates, bispecific proteins, and cell and gene therapies accounted for about a third of 2022’s approvals, helping push biologics approvals ahead of small molecules for the first time (Fig. 1 and Table 1).\\nThe US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) toughened its stand on Accelerated Approvals and submissions based on China-only data. But it also waved through some drugs despite negative votes or previous rejections, published new plans to speed up access to treatments for rare neurodegenerative diseases, and continues to expand faster approval options (Box 1). The agency also appears to be loosening the reins on cheaper biosimilars.\\nTwo reversals captured the mood of uncertainty in 2022. Amylyx Pharmaceuticals’ neurodegenerative disease drug Relyvrio (sodium phenylbutyrate and taurursodiol) was approved in September 2022 for patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) after a negative advisory committee vote in March 2022 and a positive one, from the same committee, in September. In between the votes, Amylyx submitted new analyses, and regulators reconsidered on the basis of the unmet need and disease severity. The FDA also, in June 2022, launched a five-year action plan for advancing development of treatments for rare neurodegenerative diseases like ALS, including a public–private partnership co-launched with the National Institutes of Health, along with efforts to improve disease characterization, discover biomarkers and enhance clinical trial access and infrastructure. The compounds in Relyvrio work together to help prevent motor neuron damage and death by blocking stress signals within cells’ mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum.\\nThe regulatory path for Ardelyx’s tenapanor has also been winding. The drug was approved for irritable bowel syndrome in 2019, as Ibsrela. In July 2021, the company received a complete response letter for its application in a second indication, to control serum phosphorus in adults with chronic kidney disease on dialysis. The company appealed, and by November 2022, tenapanor had received a positive vote from the cardiovascular and renal drugs advisory committee. The drug inhibits the sodium hydrogen exchanger 3 (NHE3) in the gut to reduce phosphate absorption through the paracellular pathway. Ardelyx claims almost 80% of patients on dialysis need this treatment as they can’t achieve target serum phosphatase, and it has carried out two phase 3 trials in 1,200 patients. The company awaits the result of the appeal. If approved in this indication, the drug would be taken as a 30-mg tablet twice daily, rather than the 50-mg twice daily regimen in irritable bowel syndrome.\\n“Ferociously unpredictable” is how one clinician-oncologist summed up 2022’s FDA — a sentiment shared by many biopharma executives. Clinical holds were abundant at the start of 2022, with 15 full or partial holds reported in the first 8 weeks, according to BioMedTracker. Yet by year’s end, the total (44) was short of 2021’s full year count (49). Complete response letters (rejections) were trending similarly to 2021 (35 versus 36) and slightly below the 40 reported in 2020, according to BioMedTracker.\\nWidening the lens to the past decade makes 2022’s approval tally look more like reversion to the norm. Between 2012 and 2021, FDA approved on average 44 drugs per year, skewed upwards by the 50+ annual tally between 2018 and 2021 (Fig. 1). Overall, it was a golden decade, with 445 new biologics and small molecule medicines, up 76% from the previous ten years. Expedited approvals — including Fast Track, Priority Review and Accelerated Approval, as well as Breakthrough Therapy or Orphan Drug designations — have also grown to about 70% of approvals in 2021 and 2022 (Table 2).\\nBut industry faced a new source of uncertainty in 2022: the Inflation Reduction Act. This law, signed in August, introduces US drug price negotiations and caps on annual price rises, with harsh penalties for flouters. Its provisions are already affecting drug development and regulatory submission decisions, with several unintended consequences (Box 2).\\nThe Inflation Reduction Act, signed into US law in August 2022, sets a path to price negotiations for some of the most costly Medicare drugs. It also curbs annual above-inflation price increases for all Medicare treatments from 2023. The Act is expected to save the government $100 billion over ten years and has provoked strong pushback from industry, which says it will dampen innovation and reduce the number of drugs in development.\\nPrice negotiations will begin in 2026 for small molecules, and two years later for biologics. Yet they apply only to the (initially ten) highest-cost Medicare drugs without generic or biosimilar competition. One controversial aspect of the law is that price negotiations won’t kick in until 13 years after approval for eligible biologics, but only 9 years after approval for small molecules, potentially dis-incentivizing small molecule R&D. New drugs like Novartis’s small interfering RNA cholesterol drug Leqvio (inclisiran), categorized as a small molecule, may come up against pricing curbs sooner than anticipated. Skewing development of medicines further toward expensive large molecules — if that occurs — would likely raise the overall bill for medicines — the opposite of what the law intended.\\nIndustry representatives say the act is already influencing pipeline prioritization decisions. For example, Alnylam says the provision to exempt single-indication orphan drugs from price negotiations led it to delay development of a second orphan indication for its rare-disease treatment Amvuttra while it evaluates the potential impact of the law.\\nAnother unintended consequence of the IRA is likely to be near-term increases in some list prices as companies seek to compensate for lower-than-hoped annual hikes down the line. Biosimilars and generics may also be negatively affected, though the law’s impact on generics remains unclear. Deals between innovator and biosimilar firms may occur, seeking to game the part of the law that allows biologic price negotiations to be delayed for up to two years if biosimilar competition is imminent.\\nMost policy experts expect legal challenges to the IRA, and many questions remain about its implementation. But it isn’t going away. Neither US political party wants to be seen favoring pharma over patient access to medicines, and other parts of the Act, like a $2,000 annual cap on out-of-pocket costs for Medicare patients, are broadly popular with voters.\\nThe Accelerated Approvals controversy continued in 2022, amid concerns that the FDA had tilted too far toward early access at the expense of robust evidence. Accelerated Approvals are granted on the basis of surrogate markers and limited clinical data, on condition that sponsors follow up with confirmatory trials. Many don’t. A study published in September 2022 by the US Department of Health and Human Services found that almost 40% of sponsors of the 278 drugs approved between 1992 and 2021 hadn’t completed them.\\nBiogen’s Alzheimer’s drug Aduhelm (aducanumab) ignited the Accelerated Approval debate in 2021. Covis Pharma’s preterm drug Makena (hydroxyprogesterone caproate injection) fanned the flames in 2022. Makena received Accelerated Approval in 2011 and has since failed a confirmatory study and twice been voted off the market by FDA advisory committees. The second vote to pull the drug was in October 2022. The FDA had yet to make its final decision as Nature Biotechnology went to press.\\nUntil recently, FDA didn’t have sufficient authority — or will — to punish sponsors who failed to generate the required data. Once a drug is on the market and some patients appear to benefit from it, withdrawal can be lengthy and difficult. It also becomes harder to recruit patients into confirmatory trials with a placebo or comparator arm, especially in rare and/or severe conditions with limited alternatives.\\nLegislation to sharpen FDA’s claws failed to get into the new five-year User Fee Reauthorization Act, signed at the very last minute on 30 September 2022. But modest reforms to Accelerated Approval were squeezed into a broader year-end spending bill. These allow the FDA to pull an approval if confirmatory studies fall short and to require that a confirmatory trial be underway before Accelerated Approval is granted. They also require sponsors to submit six-monthly trial progress reports.\\nSeveral events in 2022 showed that the FDA is clamping down anyway. Seven new drugs were granted Accelerated Approval — the 2022 count includes Mirati Therapeutics’ adagrasib (Krazati) for KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC, approved 12 December — against nine the year before. One of 2021’s approvals, TG Therapeutics’ lymphoma treatment Ukoniq (umbralisib), was withdrawn in June 2022, after less than 18 months, owing to safety concerns. One of 2020’s Accelerated Approval cohort, GlaxoSmithKline’s antibody–drug conjugate Blenrep (belantamab mafodotin-blmf), was withdrawn in November 2022, two weeks after reporting a failed phase 3 confirmatory trial in relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. (An early trial showed a third of patients responding to the drug, but it did not appear to extend progression-free survival in the confirmatory trial. GSK says it will continue the trial program and try to find a way forward.) In late November, Basel, Switzerland-based Roche pulled Tecentriq (atezolizumab) for urothelial carcinoma, a type of bladder cancer, six years after its first approval.\\nThe FDA’s tightening appears to be deterring Accelerated Approval submissions. ADC Therapeutics said it wouldn’t pursue one for its Hodgkin’s lymphoma drug camidanlumab tesirine because the FDA had required a phase 3 program be planned and underway before the review started. Section 506(c) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act allows the FDA to make such a request, but the wording of the procedural guidance leaves wiggle room, which FDA officials wanted to limit. The new legislation helps with that. Commissioner Robert Califf spoke at The Organisation for Professionals in Regulatory Affairs annual symposium in October about industry’s failure to provide confirmatory evidence and the need for reform “in one way or another.” Richard Pazdur, head of the FDA’s Oncology Center of Excellence, reported in a perspective paper in the New England Journal of Medicine that having a trial underway at approval shortens the time to withdrawal (if needed) by three-and-a-half years on average.\\nTitles on an FDA list of planned procedural guidances for 2022 included “Civil monetary penalties for failure to meet accelerated post-marketing requirements” (not yet published) and “Considerations for rescinding breakthrough therapy designations” (draft guidance published in June 2022).\\nAn FDA that holds drug sponsors to account for confirmatory trial data and timelines is good for patients and payers. It also makes sense “for the long-term health of the industry,” tweeted Atlas Venture partner Bruce Booth in response to GSK’s news. (The European Medicines Agency’s conditional approval pathway mandates follow-up studies within defined timelines, with the threat of regulatory action if sponsors fail to comply.)\\nAccelerated Approval reforms aside, expedited pathways are here to stay. The FDA is pursuing several programs to expand and refine speedy reviews, including through new regulator-sponsored meetings, the Oncology Center of Excellence’s Project Confirm (designed to bring greater transparency and discussion to Accelerated Approvals in cancer) and an expansion of the Split Real Time Application Review (STAR) pilot beyond oncology. Other commitments (spelled out in the 2023–2027 User Fee Reauthorization Act goals) include advancing novel efficacy endpoint development for rare disease drugs and continuing the use of real-world evidence to support labeling or postapproval study requirements.\\nBy year-end 2022, the number of biologic approvals narrowly outpaced that of small-molecule new molecular entities (NMEs), a landmark in biologics’ steady rise since the end of the twentieth century. Like small molecules, they’re being combined and finding new indications: AstraZeneca’s CTLA-4 inhibitor Imjudo (tremelimumab-actl) was approved in October 2022 for unresectable liver cancer and, the following month, in combination with Imfinzi (durvalumab) and chemotherapy in patients with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) not harboring epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) mutations. Merck’s anti-PD-1 (programmed cell death protein-1) behemoth Keytruda (pembrolizumab) in 2022 added advanced endometrial cancer to its 30+ tally of approved indications, with another lined up for 2023 after an overall survival hit in a phase 3 trial in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma. The company is running over a dozen trials of Keytruda in early-stage disease.\\nAnother force driving biologics’ growth is their evolution beyond simple antibodies, peptides or enzymes. Newer modalities including bispecific proteins, antibody–drug conjugates, and cell or gene therapies accounted for about half of biologic approvals through the end of November 2022, up from less than a third in 2021.\\nOxford, UK-based ImmunoCore’s Kimmtrak (tebentafusp-tebn), a bispecific T cell engager protein approved for unresectable or metastatic uveal melanoma, was first out of the gate in January 2022. It comprises a soluble T cell receptor fused to an anti-CD3 immune effector that redirects T cells to target glycoprotein 100 (gp100)-expressing melanoma cells. Kimmtrak, the first therapy for metastatic uveal melanoma, benefited from Breakthrough designation and Real Time Oncology Review and was assessed concurrently by other health authorities, including European Medicines Agency, under Project Orbis. (It was approved in Europe in April 2022.)\\nKimmtrak paved the way for other bispecifics designed to bind specific cancer and immune system targets to generate a more powerful anticancer response. Johnson & Johnson’s Tecvayli (teclistamab-cqyv), approved in October for advanced multiple myeloma, is a bispecific T cell engager antibody that latches onto T cells, via the surface CD3 receptor, and to B cell maturation antigen (BCMA) expressed on myeloma cells. The big pharma on 9 December submitted another bispecific, talquetamab, which targets CD3 and GPRC5D, a new multiple myeloma target.\\nIn the closing weeks of 2022, the FDA approved Roche’s bispecific antibody Lunsumio (mosunetuzumab) for follicular lymphoma that has failed least two previous therapies. It targets CD20 on B cells and CD3 on T cells, redirecting the latter to engage and destroy the B cells. Lunsumio received conditional approval in Europe in June. Another Roche bispecific, Vabysmo (faricimab-svoa) was approved in 2022 for wet age-related macular degeneration and diabetic macular edema. Vabysmo targets the angiopoietin-2 and vascular endothelial growth factor-A pathways that contribute to vision loss in these conditions.\\nBispecifics may provide a more convenient alternative to CAR-T cell therapies, whose complex, expensive manufacture and administration have limited their reach and commercial fortunes. Earlier in 2022, Johnson & Johnson and partner Legend Biotech won approval for Carvykti (ciltacabtagene autoleucel), a BCMA-directed CAR-T cell therapy, in the same indication as Tecvayli: adults having received at least four lines of previous therapy, including a proteasome inhibitor, an immunomodulatory agent and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody.\\nCarvykti became the sixth CAR-T cell therapy in the United States (Table 3). The CAR-T cell R&D pipeline is huge, including sponsors seeking more convenient allogeneic (off the shelf) varieties and ‘point of care’ manufacturing facilities to expand access, as well as those seeking to address solid tumors. In October, Europe’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use recommended approval of what could be the first ever allogeneic T cell therapy, Atara Biotherapeutics’ tabelecleucel (Tab-cel) for Epstein–Barr virus (EBV)-positive post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease. Tab-cel uses EBV-directed T cells from healthy donors. A US biologic license application has been delayed owing to comparability issues between commercial and pivotal clinical trial product.\\nAnother new modality arrived 30 November, when the FDA approved the first fecal microbiome product, Rebyota (fecal microbiota, live-jslm), for people with recurrent Clostridioides difficile infections following antibiotic treatment. The product is prepared from stool donated by healthy individuals, screened for pathogens, and administered as a one-time enema to restore a healthy balance of bacteria in the colon. The approval, granted to Saint-Prex, Switzerland-based Ferring Pharmaceuticals, follows several setbacks across the field and could open the gates for other similar treatments. Seres Therapeutics completed a rolling submission of its orally administered microbiome therapeutic, also for C. difficile, in September 2022. Fecal microbiota transplants — doses of untampered stool — have been used to manage this condition, but regulation and quality control are difficult.\\nA triplet of gene and cell therapies approved in the US during 2022 underscored the continued growth of this class. Yet, with each one costing over $2 million, they also fueled the drug pricing debate.\\nIn August, bluebird bio’s Zynteglo (betibeglogene autotemcel) became the first FDA-approved stem cell-based gene therapy for patients with β-thalassemia requiring regular transfusions. It genetically modifies patients’ bone marrow stem cells to produce functional β-globin, and helped 89% of patients in two multi-center trials to achieve transfusion independence for at least a year.\\nIn Europe, where Zynteglo was approved in 2019, German and other payers refused to pay the approximately $1.7 million price tag (even with a pay-for-performance clause), so bluebird retreated from the continent two years later. In the United States, Zynteglo was priced at $2.8 million, with a deal to refund 80% for patients failing to maintain transfusion independence up to two years later. (The US-based Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) said $2.1 million, with some restitution depending on outcome, would represent value-for-money.)\\nZynteglo became the most expensive drug ever — for about a month. Then a second bluebird gene therapy, Skysona (elivaldogene autotemcel), received Accelerated Approval to slow neurologic dysfunction in boys aged 4–17 with cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy (CALD), a rare neurological disorder. It was priced at $3 million. Skysona involves adding functional copies of the ABCD1 gene, which is mutated in CALD, to patients’ blood stem cells using a lenti-D viral vector, then re-infusing the engineered cells. These help patients break down very long chain fatty acids that build up because of the mutations. A confirmatory study was underway at the time of the approval.\\nSkysona faced an FDA clinical hold in 2021 due to a patient developing myelodysplastic syndrome (possibly due to the viral vector) and carries a warning for hematologic malignancy. It was approved in Europe in 2021 but withdrawn when bluebird pulled out of the region.\\nCSL Behring and licensee UniQure, based in Amsterdam, took the title for the most expensive drug in November with their $3.5 million price tag on Hemgenix (etranacogene dezaparvovec-drlb), the first FDA-approved gene therapy for hemophilia B. Patients with this bleeding disorder lack clotting factor IX and require regular blood transfusions. Hemgenix uses an adeno-associated virus vector to deliver a factor IX gene to eligible patients on prophylaxis therapy or at risk of hemorrhage or spontaneous bleeding.\\nOne-time therapies like Hemgenix can lead to significant system savings if they work. The problem is that payers on the hook for up-front costs don’t always benefit from the downstream savings. ICER said Hemgenix would offer value priced up to $2.9 million, given high transfusion costs.\\nThere are now over a dozen FDA-approved cell and gene therapies (Ferring’s gene therapy Adstiladrin (nadofaragene firadenovec-vncg) got over the line for bladder cancer in mid-December), with more coming. BioMarin’s gene therapy Roctavian (valoctocogene roxaparvovec) for severe hemophilia A was resubmitted in October 2022 after a rebuff in 2020; a decision is expected in March 2023.\\nThe European Medicines Agency granted conditional approval to Roctavian in August 2022 — another example, along with Lunsumio and bluebird’s gene therapy duo, of Europe-first approvals for next-generation biologics. Most drugs are submitted and approved initially in the United States for commercial reasons: Europe’s tough reimbursement hurdles mean early approval doesn’t always translate into faster access. US and European regulators have historically agreed on whether to approve most new drugs and continue to cooperate.\\nYet regulators everywhere need time to properly investigate and understand the tools, approaches and manufacturing requirements underpinning many new medicines. The FDA in August 2022 put the brakes on some next-generation gene editing programs, including BEAM Therapeutics’ BEAM-201, an anti-CD7 multiplex-edited allogeneic CAR-T cell program for advanced T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and lymphoma. BEAM’s technology allows several single bases to be edited at the same time, and the FDA wanted further information on off-target editing before allowing BEAM-201 to progress into humans. On 7 November, Verve Therapeutics’ gene editing medicine for heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia was also held up before entering the clinic. It involves a single A-to-G base change that disrupts PCSK9 protein production, lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the blood.\\nThese delays are usually temporary. The hold on BEAM-201 came off on 2 December. A previous hold on first-generation CRISPR players Vertex Pharmaceuticals and Zug, Switzerland-based CRISPR Therapeutics was also lifted within months.\\nThe FDA issued four sets of cell and gene therapy guidance for industry in 2022, including draft guidance on CAR-T cell therapy development and the development of gene therapy products incorporating gene editing.\\nNot all 2022’s cohort of new modalities were biologics. Alnylam Pharmaceuticals’ next-generation small interfering RNA (siRNA) drug Amvuttra (vutrisiran) in June became the fifth FDA-approved siRNA treatment. Amvuttra is indicated for polyneuropathy in hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (ATTR), a rare debilitating condition that affects nerves, the heart and other organs. It’s a more convenient version of Alnylam’s Onpattro (patisiran), delivered as a quarterly subcutaneous injection rather than as an intravenous infusion every three weeks, thanks to enhanced stability and N-acetylgalactosamine conjugation.\\nBoth drugs are also in development for the more common ATTR with cardiomyopathy, where the only approved therapy, Pfizer’s transthyretin-stabilizing non-NSAID benzoxazole derivative Vyndaqel (tafamidis meglumine) had $2 billion in sales in 2021. Alnylam plans a supplementary new drug application in 2022 for Onpattro; the plan to expand Amvuttra’s indications may be affected by the Inflation Reduction Act (Box 2). AstraZeneca and Ionis Pharmaceuticals plan to file their once-monthly antisense oligonucleotide eplontersen for the polyneuropathy ATTR subtype during 2022, following interim phase 3 results.\\nTargeted radiopharmaceutical (or radioligand) therapies is another emerging NME class that gained prominence in 2022. These link tumor-targeting molecules to cancer-destroying radioactive isotopes to create precise radiation therapy. Basel-based Novartis’s Pluvicto (lutetium (177Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan) was approved in March for prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-positive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer after other therapies. The vipivotide tetraxetan latches onto the PSMA found on the surface of many prostate cancer cells and lutetium-177 provides the targeted radiation. It was approved with a complementary diagnostic imaging agent that uses gallium (68Ga) gozetotide injection to identify PSMA-positive lesions via position emission tomography (PET) scan.\\nPluvicto is the first FDA approval of a targeted radioligand since Novartis’s Lutathera (lutetium 177Lu dotatate) in 2018 for gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). Unconjugated radiotherapeutics had arrived five years earlier, with Leverkusen, Germany-based Bayer’s prostate cancer treatment Xofigo (radium-223 dichloride). Xofigo doesn’t include a separate ligand-targeting molecule; the radium itself, which is chemically like calcium, is attracted to actively growing bone tissue such as prostate cancer bone metastases.\\nLutathera and Pluvicto came from Novartis’s 2018 acquisitions of Advanced Accelerator Applications and Endocyte, respectively. 2022 saw action among other radiopharmaceuticals-focused biotechs: in November, Lantheus paid $260 million up front to Point Biopharma for licenses to a phase 3 177Lu-based PSMA-targeted therapy like Pluvicto and to PNT2003 (lutetium-177 octreotate), which, like Lutathera, targets the somatostatin receptor in gastroenteropancreatic NETs. ITM Isotope Technologies Munich’s phase 3 candidate ITM-11, comprising lutetium-177 and edotreotide, a NET-targeting synthetic form of somatostatin, received FDA Fast Track designation in October.\\nFittingly perhaps, in the same year that new biologic approvals surpassed those of small molecules, FDA loosened the reins on biosimilars. Two such drugs — lower-cost copies of reference biologics — were granted ‘interchangeable’ status in 2022, meaning they can be substituted by pharmacists in place of the originator drug, without physician say-so. There were two interchangeable designations in 2021 too, but the more recent duo — Coherus’s Cimerli (ranibizumab-eqrn), mirroring Genentech’s Lucentis, and Eli Lilly’s Lantus biosimilar Rezvoglar (insulin glargine-aglr) — did not require switching studies to achieve the stamp. (Switching studies are designed to show that patients achieve the same outcome whether they switch between biosimilar and reference drug or remain on the reference drug throughout.)\\nThis more relaxed approach to studies brings the United States closer in line with Europe, where, for this and other reasons, biosimilar penetration and resulting savings are much more significant. Drug pricing and value decisions are not in the FDA’s remit. But the agency is authorized under the 2021 Advancing Education on Biosimilars Act to educate consumers and providers on biologic products, including biosimilars. The agency also meets regularly with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services on implementing the Inflation Reduction Act, according to Sarah Yim, director of the FDA’s Office of Therapeutic Biologics and Biosimilars, speaking at an Association for Accessible Medicines conference in early November (Box 2).\\nThe FDA’s 2023–2027 goals include a regulatory science pilot to improve the efficiency of biosimilar development. “We’re really focusing on how to develop an interchangeable product,” said FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research deputy director Jacqueline Corrigan-Curay at the same conference. A bill designed to remove switching study requirements for interchangeability was introduced into the US Senate in November.\\nWhile encouraging biosimilar development, FDA put the brakes on another strategy to help reduce the rising cost burden of biologics. Companies like EQRx hoped to develop anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 (programmed cell death ligand-1) monoclonal antibodies and other me-too biologics in China, where development costs are lower, and sell them relatively cheaply in the United States. But in 2022, the FDA pushed back strongly on China-only submissions — a stance that several drug sponsors feel is less about clinical science and more to do with the frosty geopolitical situation.\\nAn application from Lilly and Jiangsu, China-based Innovent Biologics for PD-1 inhibitor sintilimab was stopped in March 2022 because its China-only NSCLC trial was deemed not generalizable to the US population owing in part to the chemotherapy comparator. Sintilimab is sold in China as Tyvyt for Hodgkin’s disease, and Lilly had promised to offer the drug at a steep discount in the United States. In May, another complete response letter went to Coherus and Shanghai-based Junshi Bioscience’s PD-1 inhibitor toripalimab for nasopharyngeal carcinoma because of a requested quality process change, with COVID-19-linked delays to China site inspections pushing the Prescription Drug User Fee Act date to 23 December. Also in May, the FDA told Hong Kong-based Hutchmed that it would need a multiregional trial to gain US approval for the small-molecule angiogenesis inhibitor and immune modulator surufatinib in pancreatic and extrapancreatic NETs, having not made that demand initially. Two positive phase 3 studies in China and a (prediscussed) US bridging study were deemed insufficient — with the choice of comparator again an issue.\\nSo EQRx in September 2022 abandoned plans to submit China-developed PD-L1 inhibitor sugemalimab in the United States as a first-line NSCLC drug for use along with chemotherapy. A US trial against another approved checkpoint inhibitor, rather than placebo, was economically unfeasible. “We were caught in a geopolitical maelstrom,” said EQRx CEO Melanie Nallicheri at the Jefferies Global Healthcare Conference in London on 17 November.\\nIt’s fair enough for the FDA to demand data representative of the US population and medical practice. Defending its position, the FDA points out that international multiregional trials are standard for registrational studies, per International Council for Harmonisation good clinical practice guidelines. Yet the agency’s stand was interpreted — rightly or wrongly — as backtracking on earlier comments from the FDA welcoming China-developed medicines. In 2019, Beijing-based BeiGene’s Brukinsa for mantle cell lymphoma, a much smaller indication than NSCLC, was approved on the basis of data predominantly — but not exclusively — from China.\\nEuropean and UK regulators appear comfortable with China-only data, according to EQRx. The group expects to submit sugemalimab to the UK’s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency this year and to the European Medicines Agency in 2023 for stage 4 NSCLC. “The applicability issue — whether it’s the right SOC [standard of care] or right degree of racial diversity” — only arises in the United States, said Nallicheri. The company is still discussing a US submission for sugemalimab in a much smaller indication, extranodal natural killer cell/T cell lymphoma.\\nFDA made broader moves to increase racial and ethnic diversity in clinical trials. In April, the agency issued a new guidance to help sponsors develop plans to enroll more participants from under-represented racial and ethnic populations, with recommendations to submit race and ethnicity diversity plans early in the development cycle and to plan public education and outreach campaigns.\\nOne aspect of trial diversity and representativeness may have far greater repercussions across drug R&D. Obesity now affects over 40% of the US adult population, and even more in some ethnic groups, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Yet patients with obesity are routinely excluded from trials. “The implications of obesity cannot be overstated. Yet there’s a deficit of evidence about medicines in obese patients,” said the FDA’s Califf on November 9. He was introducing a workshop, co-hosted by FDA and the University of Maryland, to review the implications of obesity for drug safety, efficacy, dosing and disposition.\\nThe FDA doesn’t currently require patient weight to be evaluated as part of dosing recommendations. But at least one invited expert, David Greenblatt from the Tufts University School of Medicine, made clear his support for “mandated study of obesity” for all new drugs. Actionable pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and dosing data in individuals with obesity already exists in the medical literature, he pointed out. Studies dating back several decades show that it can take longer for them to achieve effective drug concentrations and full wash-out, and that half-lives of some treatments can be over five times longer in those with obesity than those with healthy weight. “We know what to do. We just need to put it in the regulations,” he said.\\nMandated inclusion of patients with obesity in clinical trials — if it happens — would add to already-rising per-patient trial costs. Such patients often have comorbidities and underlying inflammation, and there are complex social, ethnic and cultural hurdles to overcome in ensuring they are adequately represented in trials. Workshop participants discussed using cost-efficient technologies such as in silico modeling and virtual patients to generate drug-specific dosing guidelines.\\nCaliff is a long-time proponent of improving evidence generation and trial design more broadly, calling for more accessible, simpler trials, better data systems and data sources, and greater use of real-world data. In a JAMA Internal Medicine Viewpoint published in October 2022, he outlined the benefits of simplified “point-of-care” trials run in clinical settings and lessons learned from the UK RECOVERY trial of COVID-19 medicines. Califf and Pazdur have also spoken out against over-reliance on single-arm trials in oncology, especially in cancers where there are existing treatments and randomized controlled trials are possible.\\nCancer continued to dominate in 2022, accounting for about a third of all new drug approvals (Fig. 2). Yet new products came online for other widespread, underserved conditions, including autoimmune disorders (psoriasis and atopic dermatitis), diabetes and heart disease.\\nThe first new drug to slow the onset of type 1 diabetes, Provention Bio’s Tzield (teplizumab-mzwv), was approved in November. This anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody, given as a daily intravenous infusion for 14 days, binds to T lymphocytes and dampens their attack on insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells. In trials, Tzield delayed the onset of more severe stage 3 diabetes (when typical symptoms including fatigue and ketoacidosis appear) by about two years, relative to placebo.\\nProgress in the quest for new drugs to combat obesity continued in 2022 with the arrival of Lilly’s dual glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)/glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) agonist Mounjaro (tirzepatide). The drug was approved for type 2 diabetes but is also fast-tracked for obesity, in which Lilly plans to initiate a rolling submission before year end.\\nJudging by its clinical results, Mounjaro may be one of the most effective obesity drugs yet. It helped nearly two-thirds of patients with obesity but without diabetes in the phase 3 SURMOUNT-1 trial to achieve at least 20% weight loss, appearing even more effective than Bagsvaerd, Denmark-based Novo Nordisk’s GLP-1 agonist Wegovy (semaglutide), whose manufacturer was unable to meet demand for the drug after its June 2021 approval. GLP-1 and GIP are incretin hormones that stimulate insulin release and expand pancreatic beta cell mass; GIP may also help improve lipid handling and enhance the appetite-suppressing effects of GLP-1. Mounjaro’s 2028 sales forecasts are close to $11 billion, according to consensus figures from Evaluate Pharma; the drug is also in development for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), heart failure and obstructive sleep apnea.\\nBristol Myers Squibb and MyoKardia’s Camzyos (mavacamten) gained approval for certain types of obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, the most common genetic heart disease (affecting about 0.2% of the population). It’s the first allosteric and reversible inhibitor of the excessive cardiac myosin–actin cross-bridge formation that marks the condition. Camzyos carries a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy for heart failure risk because it reduces left ventricular ejection fraction.\\nThe year also saw positive data readouts in two other major under-served illnesses: Alzheimer’s disease and schizophrenia. Biogen and Tokyo-based Eisai’s Aduhelm follow-up lecanemab, an amyloid-β protofibril-targeting antibody that the FDA accepted in July 2022 for Accelerated Approval and Priority Review, reported positive phase 3 data showing a 27% reduction in the rate of cognitive decline versus placebo over 18 months among patients with early Alzheimer’s. The FDA’s decision is expected 6 January 2023; Eisai also plans to push ahead with a full approval submission, which is more likely to support Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement. (Aduhelm isn’t reimbursed other than for patients in clinical trials.)\\nLilly also reported positive phase 3 results at six months for its anti-amyloid-β donanemab at the Clinical Trials on Alzheimer’s Disease conference on November 30. In a head-to-head trial versus Aduhelm, it reduced amyloid plaque by 65.2% — almost four times the 17% Aduhelm achieved over the same period. Full trial results are expected in mid-2023; FDA granted Priority Review and Accelerated Approval in August.\\nRoche was unable to equal the feat with gantenerumab, which targets amyloid-β oligomers and fibrils. The antibody failed to meet primary endpoints in two 1,000-patient studies, but the company is pursuing phase 2 development of a version of the antibody that crosses the blood–brain barrier more easily.\\nIn schizophrenia, Karuna Therapeutics in August 2022 reported positive top-line phase 3 results for its muscarinic agonist–antagonist combination xanomeline–trospium. The muscarinic agonist xanomeline preferentially stimulates M1 and M4 muscarinic receptors in the brain and nervous system while antagonist trospium, whose positive charge means it can’t cross the blood–brain barrier, helps limit the gastrointestinal side effects resulting from peripheral muscarinic receptor stimulation. Neither molecule is new: xanomeline was discovered in the 1990s, but trials in Alzheimer’s and schizophrenia were discontinued because of adverse events; trospium is used for overactive bladder. Yet together, they led to a statistically significant reduction in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) relative to placebo. A submission is planned for mid-2023; if approved, the product — protected by method, formulation and composition patents — would be the first new treatment class for schizophrenia in half a century, according to CEO and chairman Steve Paul.\\nThere were also new treatments for rare conditions: Paris-based Sanofi’s Enjaymo (sutimlimab-jome), a complement C1s-targeting humanized monoclonal antibody, was approved to counter hemolysis in cold agglutinin disease and thereby reduce the need for transfusions. Agios Pharmaceuticals’ oral Pyrukynd (mitapivat) became the first approved disease-modifying agent for hemolytic anemia in pyruvate kinase deficiency. Marinus Pharmaceuticals’ oral Ztalmy (ganaxolone), a neuroactive steroid γ-aminobutyric acid receptor A (GABAA) modulator, was approved for seizures in cyclin-dependent kinase-like-5 deficiency disorder.\\nFDA appeared jittery in 2022, but a more positive reading puts it in ‘reset’ mode after a tumultuous two years. Califf, who took on his role in February 2022, faced a huge in-tray. Alongside drug reviews, site inspections and cleaning up Accelerated Approvals came an infant formula supply crisis exacerbated by global events and the tail end of COVID-19. (The latest extension to the US public emergency, issued by the Department of Health and Human Services, runs to 11 January 2023.) The FDA issued three initial Emergency Use Authorizations for COVID-19 vaccines or treatments in 2022 and later revised one of those, for Lilly’s neutralizing immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal antibody bebtelovimab, because it lacked efficacy against what had become the most prevalent Omicron subvariants.\\nWith over 130 active biologic license applications and new drug applications underway, according to BioMedTracker, there is plenty of scope for US approvals to pick up again in 2023. Yet a more stringent FDA, as well as the specter of drug price negotiations, make that an uncertain bet.'},\n",

       "    'fulltext': 'Pharmacists must dispense a large number of drugs correctly and quickly within a predetermined time for each patient’s medical therapy, and accurate dispensing is arguably one of the most important steps when providing medical care. Consequently, medical institutions make notable efforts to prevent erroneous dispensing of medication. In Kyushu University Hospital, due to the continuous efforts to prevent near misses and dispensing errors, the incidence rate of patients using incorrect drugs has been maintained at 0.038% or less since 2006. However, as “human beings can make mistakes,” the prevention of all human errors is extremely difficult. Accordingly, dispensing operations have become mechanized in many medical institutions, such as with one-dose package machines. However, pharmacists continue to have many opportunities that require manually dispensing drugs. Therefore, pharmacists need to take concrete measures to prevent dispensing errors and strive to maintain an environment that promotes safe dispensing, in parallel with the positive introduction of mechanical support. Thus, pharmacists must know in advance what kind of circumstances (drug type, drug arrangement, and drug position) are most associated with dispensing errors.\\nThe verification method used in this study was based on a previously reported method: Elucidation of Occurrence Mechanism of Dispensing Errors Based on Gaze Movement of Pharmacists Using Eye Tracking Method, Jpn J Pharm Health Care Sci, in which we clarified the basic confirmation of target drugs by using the eye-tracking method to analyze the gaze movements of 12 pharmacists. Eye-tracking uses sensor technology to detect a person’s eye movements and follows what the person is looking at in real-time. In the previous study, we revealed the following points by changing the placement (left or right area) of the target drugs and/or using three error-induction models, such as those designed to locate “double-type drugs” adjacent to each other or diagonally to the left or right of each other. First, the complexity of the dispensing process is based on “single-type drug < double-type drug; and left area < right area.” Second, locating “double-type drugs” diagonally to the upper right is effective in avoiding the dispensing errors. Third, pharmacists can change the confirmation timing of the “total amount” in the prescription area according to the circumstances. However, the errors associated with “double-type drugs” are still prevalent and often have a negative impact on patients. Hence, in this study, we investigated the gaze movements of pharmacists in detail by dividing the dispensing information into four categories (drug name, drug usage, location number, and total amount). We also analyzed the differences in error occurrence among three models: error-induction (−)/photo (+); error-induction (+)/photo (+); and error-induction (+)/photo (−) to clarify the causes of near misses and dispensing errors. Furthermore, we analyzed the gaze movements of pharmacists who dispensed drugs without errors to clarify the thinking processes required to avoid dispensing errors. This study differs from previous studies as it analyzed the confirmation procedure of dispensing information in great detail, proved the usefulness of drug photographs when displayed in complicated environments, and clarified the thinking process of pharmacists required to avoid dispensing errors.\\nEye-tracking is a method of verifying gaze movements by detecting the corneal reflex of infrared rays and is used in various fields, such as medicine, psychology, and cognitive science. We investigated the gaze movements of pharmacists during the dispensing process using the eye-tracking method. Verification was conducted under the direction of research advisors (Kimochi Labo, Inc.), who were considered eye-tracking system experts, and a glasses-like eye tracker (Eye Tracking Glasses 2.0, SMI, Teltow, Germany) was used. In this investigation, we projected an inverted image from the backside of a large transparent screen (120\\u2009cm\\u2009×\\u2009160\\u2009cm), and the drug rack area on the screen was almost the same scale as one in an actual dispensing environment (80\\u2009cm\\u2009×\\u2009160\\u2009cm). The coordinates (x, y) on the large screen were set as follows: the upper left (0, 0), lower left (0, 960), and upper right (1280, 0). Gaze movements obtained by eye-tracking were mainly classified as fixation (stagnation for a certain time) and saccade (quick movements of the eyeballs). In this study, fixation and saccade were judged from the viewpoint coordinates (px) on the x and y axes according to the study method described by Buscher et al.. Additionally, fixation in this study was defined as using a 20-pixel window and stagnation for a minimum duration of 100\\u2009ms.\\nThe inclusion criteria for pharmacists in this study were as follows. First, pharmacists should be able to read the dispensing information displayed on the large screen with their naked eyes or while using soft contact lenses; this was an essential criteria required for accurate eye movement measurement. Second, pharmacists should have more than 2 years of dispensing experience at the Kyushu University Hospital; this was essential to maintain the quality of verification above a certain level. Lastly, pharmacists should agree to participate in this study. The drugs used in this study as target drugs were the single-type drugs (three drugs) and double-type drugs (six drugs) dispensed in our hospital. Here, “single-type drug” refers to the drugs available in only one form in our hospital, while “double-type drug” refers to a pair of drugs with the same name (character part) but different ingredient quantity (number part). The single- and double-type drugs were as follows:\\nSingle-type drugs: Medrol® 4\\u2009mg tablet, Pariet® 10\\u2009mg tablet, Eurodin® 2\\u2009mg tablet.\\nDouble-type drugs: Decadron® 4\\u2009mg tablet, Takecab® 10\\u2009mg tablet, Benzalin® 2\\u2009mg tablet.\\nLixiana® 30\\u2009mg tablet, Takecab® 20\\u2009mg tablet, Benzalin® 5\\u2009mg tablet\\nThe slides used for verification in this study were created using Microsoft® PowerPoint® 2016. By dividing the verification slide into a drug rack area (upper part) and a prescription area (lower part), we were able to investigate the gaze movements of pharmacists in the dispensing process using a single slide. The target drugs on each slide were either three single-type drugs or three double-type drugs. The drug rack area in the upper part of the slide was a grid-like rack composed of 5 rows ×\\u200911 columns, and each cell contained a name label of the drug and a color photograph of two tablets in a press-through package (PTP) sheet or a grey illustration of them. There were 55 drugs (including three target drugs), excluding powerful and poisonous drugs, displayed in the drug rack area. In addition, the drugs with the same initial character, the same ingredient quantity (number part), and similar appearance as a target drug were not displayed in the same row as the target drug. Furthermore, the three target drugs were not displayed in the outermost cells of the 5 rows ×\\u200911 columns grid, and not located in the same row and column (2–02, 3–03, 4–04). In the prescription area present in the lower part of the slide, each piece of dispensing information (drug name, drug usage, location number, and total amount) for three target drugs was displayed. The “drug usage” was either “1\\u2009T/after breakfast” or “1\\u2009T/before sleeping,” and the same numeric character was not used repeatedly in the verification of each target drug to avoid confusion. Details of the dispensing information are presented in Table\\xa01.\\nA pharmacist waits while gazing at a given position.\\nAn assistant in this study switches to a verification slide according to the “Next” signal indicated by the pharmacist.\\nThe pharmacist reads out the “total amount” of a target drug while pointing at the target spot and repeats this process a total of three times.\\nThe assistant switches to a rest slide according to the “Next” signal indicated by the pharmacist.\\nThe verifications, using more than 15 slides, are repeated with voluntary breaks.\\nThe verification outline when using the eye-tracking method is shown in Fig.\\xa01. A pharmacist, with his/her forehead and chin fixed, was seated on a chair 200\\u2009cm from the large screen. In addition, pharmacists were allowed to practice with training slides in advance to get used to the verification process. Furthermore, smooth dispensing, as usual, was prioritized in this verification, and if a pharmacist noticed a mistake in the dispensing process, he/she was allowed to correct it immediately. In this way, we analyzed a series of processes, from confirming the dispensing information in the prescription area (40\\u2009cm\\u2009×\\u2009160\\u2009cm) to pointing at the target spot in the drug rack area (80\\u2009cm\\u2009×\\u2009160\\u2009cm).\\nIn the prescription area\\n(a) drug name, (b) drug usage, (c) location number, (d) total amount\\nIn the drug rack area\\n(e) target spot\\nBetween the prescription area and drug rack area\\n(f) vertical movement\\nIn this study, four verification items were used in the prescription area: (a) drug name, (b) drug usage, (c) location number, and (d) total amount; therefore,12 checkpoints (4 items ×\\u20093 target drugs) were present. Additionally, in the drug rack area, (e) target spot was used as an item; therefore, 3 checkpoints (1 item ×\\u20093 target drugs) were present. We investigated the gaze frequency for (a)–(e), as well as the number of (f) vertical movements between the two areas. Furthermore, we investigated the length of dispensing time required to identify the three target drugs.\\nWe set up four normal models (groups A, B, C, and D) to investigate the gaze movements of 12 pharmacists and analyze the basic process of identifying the target drugs. A pair of a single-type drug and a double-type drug in groups A and B (likewise, those in groups C and D) had the same efficacy, the same ingredient quantity (number part), and the same position but had different names (character part). In addition, single-type drugs in groups A and C (likewise, double-type drugs in groups B and D) were the same, but their positions were shifted six rows to the right and left. Detailed information on the following four groups and the arrangement of the target drugs are shown in Table 1 and Fig.\\xa02.\\nGroup A: single-type drug/photo (+)/left area\\nGroup B: double-type drug/photo (+)/left area\\nGroup C: single-type drug/photo (+)/right area\\nGroup D: double-type drug/photo (+)/right area\\nIn this study, “double-type drugs” referred to a pair of drugs with the same name (character part) but different ingredient quantity (number part), and drugs other than the target drugs (the other half of double-type drugs) were referred to as “non-target drugs.” By arranging the non-target drugs on the right side of the target drugs, we created a complicated environment (so-called “error-induction model”) in which near misses and dispensing errors were likely to occur. The presence or absence of error-induction and drug photographs in the three models (groups E, F, and G) are shown below. Detailed information on the following three groups and the arrangement methods of the target drugs are shown in Table 1 and Fig. 2.\\nGroup E: double-type drug /error-induction (−)/photo (+)/center area\\nGroup F: double-type drug /error-induction (+)/photo (+)/center area\\nGroup G: double-type drug /error-induction (+)/photo (−)/center area\\nDuring the verification process, when a pharmacist visually recognized a non-target drug, it was defined as a “visual invasion.” Additionally, when they pointed at a drug other than the target drug or read out the incorrect total amount, it was defined as a “dispensing error.” Furthermore, when they realized that there was a dispensing error and corrected it immediately, it was defined as a “near miss.” Furthermore, to determine whether visual invasion occurred, we checked for the presence or absence of gazing at each of the non-target drugs, and divided the number of times gazing at non-target drugs by 36 (3 points ×\\u200912 pharmacists) to calculate the occurrence rate. Likewise, the occurrence rates of “near miss” and “dispensing error” were calculated using the same method. Accordingly, we investigated the differences in error occurrences between groups E and F, and between groups F and G to analyze the factors involved.\\nTo analyze in detail the best confirmation methods for dispensing to avoid errors in complicated environments, we re-defined the three groups (E’, F′, and G’) by excluding the data of pharmacists who showed errors in dispensing. Accordingly, we investigated the gaze movements of pharmacists who performed dispensing without errors and analyzed the difference in the thinking processes of the pharmacists, which led to them to avoid dispensing errors between groups E’ and F′, and between groups F′ and G’.\\nGaze coordinates (px) and gaze classification (fixation, saccade) data in Excel format, and the motion picture data recorded from the gaze movements of the 12 pharmacists were provided by the research advisors. Using these data, we analyzed the gaze frequency in the prescription and drug rack areas, the number of vertical movements between the two areas, and the length of dispensing time. Verification data were indicated using the mean\\u2009±\\u2009standard deviation of subjects and analyzed using paired t-tests to obtain the significance; P values of <\\u20090.05 were considered statistically significant. Fisher’s exact test was used to analyze the differences in the occurrence rates of visual invasions, near misses, and dispensing errors between the two error induction models. Pearson’s correlation coefficient test was used to analyze the correlation of the verification data between the items in each group. The paired t-test, Fisher’s exact test, and Pearson’s correlation coefficient test were performed using the JMP version 16 statistical software.\\nThis study was approved by the Clinical Trials Ethics Committee of Kyushu University Hospital (approval number: 29066). The pharmacists were given a prior explanation of the research content, and their written consent was obtained. In carrying out this research, they complied with the Ethical Guidelines for Medical Research for Humans.\\nThe participants in this study included 12 pharmacists (6 men and 6 women). The average age of the pharmacists was 31.8\\u2009±\\u20094.0\\u2009years old, and they were all right-handed. The average period of dispensing experience was 7.5\\u2009±\\u20094.3\\u2009years. In addition, on the basis of the motion picture data of the 12 participants provided by the research advisors, we could judge various situations such as gazing point (center point in circle), gazing time (size of circle), and gaze movement (line between the center points in circles) of 12 pharmacists, as shown in Fig. 1.\\nTo clarify the ordinary thinking processes of the 12 pharmacists, we analyzed their gaze movements using four normal models (groups A, B, C, and D). The gaze frequency for (a) drug name, (b) drug usage, (c) location number, (d) total amount in the prescription area, (e) target spot in the drug rack area, and (f) vertical movement between the two areas are shown below. The lengths of the dispensing time in four normal models (groups A, B, C, and D) were 14.3\\u2009±\\u20093.1, 16.6\\u2009±\\u20094.5, 17.8\\u2009±\\u20094.3, and 20.0\\u2009±\\u20094.5\\u2009s, respectively.\\nGroup A: (a) 3.8\\u2009±\\u20090.9, (b) 3.0\\u2009±\\u20090.7, (c) 3.3\\u2009±\\u20090.6, (d) 5.7\\u2009±\\u20091.1, (e) 5.3\\u2009±\\u20091.3, (f) 10.6\\xa0± 2.7\\nGroup B: (a) 4.6\\u2009±\\u20091.3, (b) 3.3\\u2009±\\u20091.1, (c) 4.0\\u2009±\\u20091.5, (d) 6.2\\u2009±\\u20091.4, (e) 6.7\\u2009±\\u20092.6, (f) 11.8\\xa0± 3.2\\nGroup C: (a) 3.8\\u2009±\\u20090.5, (b) 3.3\\u2009±\\u20090.8, (c) 3.3\\u2009±\\u20090.5, (d) 6.0\\u2009±\\u20090.9, (e) 6.3\\u2009±\\u20092.0, (f) 11.8\\xa0± 2.4\\nGroup D: (a) 4.5\\u2009±\\u20091.2, (b) 3.5\\u2009±\\u20090.8, (c) 4.3\\u2009±\\u20091.5, (d) 6.8\\u2009±\\u20090.7, (e) 7.3\\u2009±\\u20091.7, (f) 13.1\\u2009±\\u20092.2\\nThe relationship of the gaze movements between groups A and B on the left area is shown in Fig.\\xa03A and that between groups C and D on the right area is shown in Fig. 3B (n\\u2009=\\u200912). Among these results, a significant difference was observed in (a) drug name on the left area (P\\u2009=\\u20090.043). Moreover, significant differences were observed in (a) drug name, (c) location number, and (f) vertical movement on the right area (P\\u2009=\\u20090.032, P\\u2009=\\u20090.042, and P\\u2009=\\u20090.021, respectively). Likewise, significant differences were observed in the lengths of the dispensing time between groups A and B, and between groups C and D (P\\u2009<\\xa00.001 and P\\u2009=\\u20090.003, respectively). In addition, there were no near-misses or dispensing errors in these four groups.\\nTo clarify the differences in the error occurrences in the dispensing process, we analyzed the gaze movements of 12 pharmacists using three models: error-induction (−)/photo (+), error-induction (+)/photo (+), and error-induction (+)/photo (−). The relationship between the occurrence rates of “visual invasion,” “near miss,” and “dispensing error” in groups E, F, and G is shown in Fig.\\xa04 (n\\u2009=\\u200912). There were no “visual invasion” data for group E as there were no error-inductions. The occurrence rates of “visual invasion” by non-target drugs in groups F and G were 50.0% (18/36) and 58.3% (21/36), respectively. The occurrence rates of “near-miss” in groups E, F, and G were 0% (0/36), 2.8% (1/36), and 2.8% (1/36), respectively, and all were mistakes associated with (d) total amount. Furthermore, the occurrence rates of “dispensing error” in groups E, F, and G were 0% (0/36), 2.8% (1/36), and 11.1% (4/36), respectively, and all were attributed to the misrecognition of “non-target drugs” located on the right side of the target drugs. In addition, there was no significant difference in the occurrence rates of visual invasions, near misses, or dispensing errors between groups G and F.\\nTo clarify the thinking processes required to avoid dispensing errors, we reanalyzed the gaze movements of pharmacists who dispensed without errors. First, we re-defined the three groups (E’, F′, and G’) by excluding the data of four pharmacists who showed errors in dispensing. The occurrence rates of “visual invasion” in groups F′ and G’ were 41.7% (15/36) and 50.0% (18/36), respectively (n\\u2009=\\u20098). Second, the gaze frequency of (a) drug name, (b) drug usage, (c) location number, and (d) total amount in the prescription area, (e) target spot in the drug rack area, and the number of (f) vertical movements between the two areas are shown below. The lengths of the dispensing time in groups E’, F′, and G’ were 19.4\\u2009±\\u20094.2, 20.6\\u2009±\\u20092.8, and 23.0\\u2009±\\u20095.0\\u2009s, respectively.\\nGroup E’: (a) 4.5\\u2009±\\u20091.4, (b) 3.5\\u2009±\\u20090.8, (c) 4.0\\u2009±\\u20090.9, (d) 5.9\\u2009±\\u20091.4, (e) 6.6\\u2009±\\u20091.4, (f) 12.8\\u2009±\\u20092.4\\nGroup F′: (a) 6.3\\u2009±\\u20092.0, (b) 3.4\\u2009±\\u20090.7, (c) 3.5\\u2009±\\u20090.8, (d) 6.3\\u2009±\\u20091.0, (e) 7.6\\u2009±\\u20091.7, (f) 14.8\\u2009±\\u20093.0\\nGroup G’: (a) 5.8\\u2009±\\u20091.6, (b) 3.9\\u2009±\\u20091.4, (c) 5.1\\u2009±\\u20091.5, (d) 6.9\\u2009±\\u20092.2, (e) 7.3\\u2009±\\u20091.8, (f) 13.4\\u2009±\\u20093.6\\nThe relationship of the gaze movements of eight pharmacists who dispensed without errors between groups E’ and F′ is shown in Fig.\\xa05A, and that between groups F′ and G’ is shown in Fig. 5B. Among these results, a significant difference was observed for (a) drug name between groups E’ and F′ (P\\u2009=\\u20090.002). Likewise, a significant difference was observed for (c) location number between groups F′ and G’ (P\\u2009=\\u20090.048). Furthermore, a strong positive correlation between (e) target spot and (f) vertical movement was observed in groups E’ (r\\u2009=\\u20090.82, P\\u2009=\\u20090.012), F′ (r\\u2009=\\u20090.77, P\\u2009=\\u20090.026), and G’ (r\\u2009=\\u20090.94, P\\u2009=\\u20090.0005).\\nIn this study, we aimed to elucidate the thinking process of pharmacists in both simple and complicated environments by utilizing eye-tracking analysis, to clarify the method of identifying target drugs and the mechanisms of error occurrence in the dispensing process. Our study revealed that adjacent placement of similar drugs had an effect on the subsequent occurrence of dispensing errors; furthermore, the elimination of image information (drug photographs) increased these errors. The findings of our study showed that pharmacists were able to change their method of identifying target drugs according to the circumstances, as they tended to depend on “what (drug name)” under error-induction (+)/photo (+), but on “where (location number)” under error-induction (+)/photo (−). In other words, the thinking processes of pharmacists depend on the dispensing environment and have an impact on the method of identifying target drugs. Therefore, this study proved the usefulness of drug photograph displays by using photo (+) and (−) models, unlike the previous study that used only photo (+) models. Moreover, this study clarified the reasons for additional confirmation of “drug name” and “location number” in the prescription area, and the detailed analysis of the confirmation procedure of dispensing information elucidated the thinking process necessary to avoid dispensing error.\\nFirst, we analyzed the gaze movements of 12 pharmacists in a simple dispensing environment using four normal models (groups A, B, C, and D). The results revealed that the confirmation frequency of (a) drug name on the left area, (a) drug name, (c) location number, and (f) vertical movement on the right area increased significantly in the relationship of “single-type drug < double-type drug” (Fig. 3A, B). On the basis of these results, we conducted a detailed analysis of the gaze movements of pharmacists to clarify why the confirmation frequency of (a), (c), and (f) increased. First, the additional confirmations of (a) drug name before / after shifting the visual line to (e) target spot were found to be groups A (3 / 7), B (5 / 14), C (2 / 7), and D (5 / 13), respectively. More than 73% (41/56) of them were after visually recognizing the target drugs in the drug rack area, suggesting that the additional confirmation of (a) drug name was a post-check to reconfirm that the target drug specified by the pharmacist was correct. Second, additional confirmations of (c) location number before / after shifting the visual line to (e) target spot were found to be groups A (2 / 1), B (11 / 1), C (3 / 1), and D (12 / 2), respectively. More than 84% (28/33) of them were before visually recognizing the target drugs in the drug rack area, indicating that the confirmation of (c) location number would be used only to pinpoint (e) target spot and was not necessary thereafter. Furthermore, it was likely to be difficult for the pharmacists to process the numerical information of (c) location number in the relationship of “single-type drug < double-type drug.” This is because the frequencies of additional confirmation of (c) location number were the above-described relations on both the left and right areas even though the target drugs were located at the same spots. Third, the rates of the visual line passing through (e) target spot in the drug rack area were found to be groups A (22.2%), B (36.1%), C (38.9%), and D (52.8%), they were also in the order “single-type drug < double-type drug (group A < group B, group C < group D).” The relationship between the additional confirmation timing of (c) location number in the prescription area and the rate of passing through (e) target spot in the drug rack area is shown in Fig.\\xa06. These results suggested that the concentration of consciousness toward “double-type drug” had a negative influence on the processing capacity for (c) location number, which further reduced the accuracy of pinpointing (e) target spot. In addition, this tendency was more remarkable on the right area than on the left area (Fig. 6A, B). As a matter fact, the location number itself (4–07, 2–05, 3–06) plays a role in the “translation code” which converts the numerical information into the position information; therefore thinking faculties such as memory, conversion, and storage are essential to pinpoint the accurate position of the target drug. It has also been reported that the memory capacity of a human is limited, for example, the amount of information that can be stocked as short-term memory is 7\\u2009±\\u20092 items, and subsequent research has reported the amount of information to be limited to 4\\u2009±\\u20091 items; however, this information gets erased with the passage of time or the intervention of other information. Therefore, it is not surprising that pharmacists need to consider more as the location number becomes more complex. In this way, it is considered that the complexity of dispensing work becomes additively or synergistically remarkable under the influence of both the type and position of the target drug. Moreover, the cumulative complexity of the confirmation process on the right area led to a significant increase in (f) vertical movement (Fig. 3B).\\nIn the next step, to clarify the causes of near misses and dispensing errors, we analyzed the differences in error occurrences using three models: error-induction (−)/photo (+), error-induction (+)/photo (+), and error-induction (+)/photo (−). First, it was revealed that the visual invasion by non-target drugs or the thinking pattern resulting from their recognition led to the subsequent occurrence of near misses and dispensing errors. This tendency is obvious from the fact that near misses were not observed in group E, where non-target drugs were not located. Second, the elimination of drug photographs in a complicated environment quadrupled the frequency of dispensing errors. This means that it was difficult for pharmacists to judge whether a target was the target drug in a complicated environment, such as with error-induction but without image information. In fact, all 12 pharmacists were able to accurately identify Takecab® 20\\u2009mg under error-induction (+)/photo (+), whereas 3 pharmacists (25%) misrecognized Takecab® 10\\u2009mg under error-induction (+)/photo (−). Human beings have the ability to process visual stimuli as a memory of color and shape. Therefore, it was suggested that pharmacists had no opportunities to utilize the color memory of Takecab® 20\\u2009mg (sky blue) and/or Takecab® 10\\u2009mg (light yellow) in group G because image information to characterize their color tones was absent there. In short, the display of image information (color, appearance, design, shape, etc.) is considered as an important factor to prevent dispensing errors in complicated environments where errors are likely to be induced.\\nFinally, to clarify the thinking process necessary to avoid dispensing errors, we analyzed the gaze movements of eight pharmacists who dispensed without errors (Fig. 5A, B). First, it was revealed that the confirmation frequency of (a) drug name in group F′ increased significantly compared to that in group E’ (Fig. 5A). In this regard, the visual recognition rate of non-target drugs located in the drug rack area was 41.7% in group F′, whereas these visual invasions did not develop into dispensing errors (n\\u2009=\\u20098), suggesting that the additional confirmation of (a) drug name was a post-check of its number part (ingredient quantity) as the pharmacist cannot judge accurately the target drug from the character part (KATAKANA notation). Second, it was shown that the confirmation frequency of (c) location number in group G’ increased significantly when compared to that in group F′ (Fig. 5B). In this regard, each change in confirmation frequency from group F′ to group G’ was −\\u20090.5/(a) drug name, +\\u20090.5/(b) drug usage, +\\u20091.6/(c) location number, +\\u20090.6/(d) total amount, −\\u20090.4/(e) target spot, and\\u2009−\\u20091.4/(f) vertical movement, respectively. In addition, since both (e) target spot and (f) vertical movement showed correlated changes in all the three groups (E’, F′, and G’), it is not a coincidence that two parameters decreased at the same time in group G’. The changes in the two items in group G’ are likely to be closely related to the results showing that the visual lines were concentrated on the peripheral part of (c) location number in the prescription area. Furthermore, the dispensing time also increased by 2.4\\u2009s with the elimination of image information, suggesting that the largest increase in dispensing time would be in processing the numerical information of (c) location number that requires thinking faculties, such as memory, conversion, and storage. In summary, we speculated that the reason why the confirmation frequency of (c) location number significantly increased by removing drug photographs was because the eight pharmacists tried to compensate for the lack of photographs by directly pinpointing the position of the target drug. However, the elimination of image information made the dispensing process more complicated, and as a result, more time was required to conduct accurate dispensing. There remain several unanswered questions regarding the mechanisms involved in human memory, it is generally considered that human beings have a network system called a “schema” which consists of a series of associations and images based on various knowledge and experience gained. For example, this matter includes a case in which we recall someone’s face almost at the same time we see or hear their name; it is no exception for pharmacists. Therefore, it appears that pharmacists can simultaneously draw out many schemas based on their pharmaceutical knowledge (medical efficacy, characteristic appearance, side effects, etc.) when they visually recognize the drug name in the prescription area. Furthermore, it has been suggested that the memory of drug information (color, appearance, design, shape, etc.) recalled as a schema is unknowingly used to match the drug photograph. In this way, the display of drug photographs is considered an important factor for not only preventing dispensing errors but also identifying the target drugs efficiently. In other words, in a complicated environment where errors are likely to be induced, there seems to be a limit to maintaining the safety in the dispensing process by using only character and numerical information.\\nOver the last few decades, the mechanization of dispensing operations, such as one-dose package machines, has spread through many medical institutions to improve dispensing efficiency. In recent years, picking methods that utilize drug barcodes have also been used to prevent dispensing errors. However, this creates several problems, such as the additional time required for dispensing work, non-readability of the barcodes cut from PTP sheets, and not preventing counting errors. Therefore, the experience and skills of pharmacists are still required to dispense drugs efficiently and quickly in real medical settings. Accordingly, pharmacists should make efforts to reduce the complexity of dispensing work and minimize dispensing errors. For this reason, pharmacists need to analyze the causes of dispensing errors and implement concrete measures to prevent them. Finally, this study had some limitations. First, we did not set a model of error-induction (−)/photo (−); therefore, we could not compare gaze movements in the presence or absence of drug photographs in a simple dispensing environment. Second, the distance between the drug rack area and the prescription area was so short that we could not accurately reproduce the thinking process of the pharmacists working in the actual dispensaries. Furthermore, since this study was a short-term simulated verification from visually recognizing target drugs to reaching out for them, we plan to verify the gaze movements of pharmacists using the eye-tracking method at the actual dispensing site the next time. Although this study was conducted by a relatively small number of pharmacists at one facility, no pharmaceutical study has analyzed the thinking process of the pharmacists in dispensing and shown clearly the moment of the occurrence of near misses and dispensing errors. Therefore, the findings of this study can serve as a reference for pharmacists in other facilities. Accordingly, this study was a meaningful investigation in that it proved the usefulness of drug photograph displays in a complicated environment and clarified the thinking process required by the pharmacist to avoid dispensing errors.\\nIn this study, we clarified the thinking process required by the pharmacist to avoid dispensing errors in a complicated dispensing environment and proved the usefulness of drug photographs in terms of reducing both the complexity of the dispensing process and the risk of dispensing error. Consequently, an effective measure for minimizing the dispensing errors associated with “double-type drugs” is to avoid locating them adjacent to each other. In particular, locating them diagonally to the upper right is effective in circumventing visual invasion by the other drugs. Furthermore, utilizing the image information (drug photographs) further reduces the complexity of the dispensing process. It is easy to change the arrangement method of double-type drugs and display their drug photographs on the drug rack, and this has already been implemented in our hospital. In this way, pharmacists should continue to work on improving the safe environment for dispensing in parallel with mechanical support, which will lead to further improvements in medical safety.\\nTT obtained funding, conducted analyses, and drafted the manuscript.

       "    'fulltext': \"Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is one of the most common infectious diseases worldwide, affecting approximately half of the global population and playing a causative role in a number of gastrointestinal diseases, including asymptomatic chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, atrophic gastritis, intestinal metaplasia, gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma, and gastric adenocarcinoma. Both the Maastricht V Consensus Report and Kyoto Global Consensus Report recognize H. pylori-associated gastritis as an infectious disease, while the World Health Organization has designated H. pylori as a carcinogen. There is also accumulating evidence that H. pylori eradication can reduce the incidence of gastric cancer.\\nProton-Pump Inhibitor (PPI) regimens are the most common first-line and salvage therapies for H. pylori eradication. However, in recent years, the success rate of PPI-containing regimens has declined, due to the increased antibiotic resistance of H. pylori. A combination of effective antibiotics and acid suppression is needed for successful eradication, but the optimal treatment regimen has yet to be determined.\\nPotassium-Competitive Acid Blockers (P-CABs) inhibit gastric acid secretion via selective and reversible inhibition of H+/K+-ATPase. Since P-CABs compete with K+, their activity is dose-dependent. Moreover, the onset of P-CAB activity is faster than that of PPI activity; moreover, acid suppression by P-CABs is of longer duration, making the latter group of drugs more potent therapies for H. pylori eradication. Furthermore, because P-CABs are acid-stable and less impaired by the CYP2C19 system than PPIs, their use in anti-H. pylori regimens have garnered considerable interest.\\nP-CABs are currently mainly approved in Asia. Vonoprazan (VPZ) is a first-in-class P-CAB available in Japan since\\xa02015, which has also been introduced in a small number of other Asian countries, mainly for gastroesophageal reflux disease and H. pylori treatment. Other P-CABs include revaprazan, tegoprazan, linaprazan, YH4808, DWP14012, KFP-H008, and SCH28080. Several recent meta-analyses have shown the superiority of P-CAB-containing therapies over PPI-containing therapies, although they mostly included retrospective studies with low levels of evidence, which limited the accuracy and reliability of the results. In addition, the conclusions were inconsistent with those of other studies. Therefore, the authors performed a meta-analysis that included only Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) to assess the efficacy and safety of P-CAB-based therapy for H. pylori eradication.\\nThe PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were systematically searched for relevant RCTs up to November\\xa010, 2021. The following search string was used: (“potassium-competitive acid blocker” or “vonoprazan” or “takecab” or “TAK438”) and (“Helicobacter pylori” or “H. pylori” or “Hp”). Related articles and citations were also considered to broaden the search. All human studies published in English were initially included. The search was conducted by two independent reviewers (Zhang Mengran and Zhang Mei); a third author (Pang Mingge) was consulted whenever disagreements arose.\\nTwo reviewers (ZMR and ZM) independently reviewed the full-text versions of all articles retrieved in the literature search to identify eligible studies. The inclusion criteria were as follows: clinical RCT comparing P-CAB- and PPI-based therapy as the primary or salvage regimen for H. pylori eradication; H. pylori infection confirmed (with one or more confirmatory tests) by a Urea Breath Test (UBT), rapid urease test, culture, or stool H. pylori antigen; eradication rate assessed by Intention-To-Treat (ITT) and Per-Protocol (PP) analyses at least\\xa04-weeks after the completion of treatment; and confirmation of H. pylori eradication, either by UBT or stool antigen test.\\nThe exclusion criteria were as follows: non-RCT; inadequate or unavailable data; abstract-only publications or unpublished; language other than English; and eradication rate not assessed.\\nTwo reviewers (ZMR and ZM) independently assessed the risk of bias of included RCTs using the Cochrane Risk of Bias assessment tool. The following items of each RCT were evaluated: (i)\\xa0Methods of random allocation; (ii)\\xa0How patient allocation was concealed; (iii)\\xa0Blinding of the patients and researchers; (iv)\\xa0Blinding of outcome assessment; (v)\\xa0Whether there were incomplete outcome data; (vi)\\xa0Whether there was selective outcome reporting; and (vii)\\xa0Other potential biases.\\nData extraction was undertaken by two investigators, independently. For each eligible study, the following data were extracted: first author, year of publication, study design, country, study period, eradication regimens, confirmative test for eradication, eradication rate, dropout rate, and adverse events.\\nMeta-analysis was performed to calculate the pooled Risk Ratios (RRs) with a 95%\\xa0Confidence Interval (CI) by using Review Manager\\xa05.3 (provided by the Cochrane Collaboration, 2014). The Chi-Square test and Higgins I2 statistic were used to estimate the heterogeneity between different studies. When p > 0.1 and I2 < 50%, it was considered that there was no heterogeneity existed, and the fixed-effect model was used. Otherwise, heterogeneity was considered to exist, and subgroup analysis or a randomized effect model was used. All p-values were two-tailed, and p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant in all tests (except for the heterogeneity test).\\nFigure\\xa01 shows a flow diagram of the present literature search. Initially, 180\\xa0studies were identified. After screening the titles and abstracts, 7\\xa0duplicate and 144\\xa0irrelevant articles were discarded. After reviewing the full-length articles, 22\\xa0were excluded based on the exclusion criteria. Ultimately, seven studies, comprising\\xa01,168\\xa0patients and meeting all eligibility criteria, were included in the present meta-analysis.\\nThe characteristics of the seven studies are summarized in Table\\xa01. The studies were published between\\xa02016 and\\xa02021, and their enrollment periods ranged from\\xa02012 to\\xa02021. All of the included studies were performed in Asia, including one study conducted in Korea and one in Thailand; the others were all conducted in Japan.\\nAmong the\\xa01,168\\xa0patients included in this meta-analysis, 593\\xa0received P-CAB-based eradication therapy (YH4804 administered to\\xa020\\xa0patients in one study; the remainder received VPZ) and 575\\xa0patients received PPI-based therapy. The\\xa01,059\\xa0patients in five studies were treatment-naïve; in the other studies, primary treatment had failed. P-CAB-based triple therapy, as first-line therapy, consisted of\\xa020\\xa0mg VPZ or\\xa0200\\xa0mg YH4804, 750\\xa0or\\xa01,000\\xa0mg amoxicillin, and 200\\xa0or\\xa0400\\xa0mg clarithromycin, twice daily for\\xa07-days. P-CAB-based triple salvage therapy consisted of\\xa020\\xa0mg VPZ, 750\\xa0mg amoxicillin, and 250\\xa0mg metronidazole or\\xa0100\\xa0mg sitafloxacin, twice daily for\\xa07-days. In PPI-based triple first-line or salvage therapy, a standard dose of a PPI (20\\xa0mg omeprazole, 20\\xa0mg esomeprazole, 30\\xa0mg lansoprazole, or\\xa010\\xa0or\\xa020\\xa0mg rabeprazole) was administered. In all seven studies, eradication success was determined based on a UBT conducted at least\\xa04-weeks after treatment completion.\\nThe risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration tool; the results are presented in Figure\\xa02. Generally, the included studies had a low risk of bias, but three studies had a high risk of bias.\\nThe pooled eradication rate determined by ITT analysis was\\xa090.2% for P-CAB-based triple therapy and 75.5% for PPI-based triple therapy. As shown in Figure\\xa03, a higher H. pylori eradication rate was achieved with P-CAB-based triple therapy than with PPI-based triple therapy (pooled RR [95%\\xa0CI]\\xa0=\\xa01.17 [1.08–1.28], p < 0.001). No significant heterogeneity was identified (I2\\xa0=\\xa043%). A similar tendency was determined in the PP analysis (pooled eradication rate\\xa0=\\xa092.4%\\xa0vs.\\xa077.8%; pooled RR [95%\\xa0CI]\\xa0=\\xa01.14\\xa0[1.03–1.26], p < 0.01), as shown in Figure\\xa04, but significant heterogeneity was identified (I2\\xa0=\\xa068%).\\nA subgroup analysis was performed according to therapy type (first-line or salvage eradication therapy); (Figs.\\xa03 and 4). In the first-line therapy subgroup, the eradication efficacy of P-CAB-based triple therapy was superior to that of PPI-based triple therapy, according to both the ITT analysis (pooled eradication rate\\xa0=\\xa091.8%\\xa0vs.\\xa076.4%; pooled RR [95%\\xa0CI]\\xa0=\\xa01.18\\xa0[1.10–1.28], p < 0.0001) and the PP analysis (pooled eradication rate\\xa0=\\xa093.0%\\xa0vs.\\xa078.6%; pooled RR [95%\\xa0CI]\\xa0=\\xa01.13\\xa0[1.02–1.26], p < 0.05). Significant heterogeneity was identified in the PP analysis (I2\\xa0=\\xa075%) but not in the ITT analysis (I2\\xa0=\\xa039%). Among patients who received P-CAB-based and PPI-based salvage therapy, the pooled eradication rate, as determined by ITT analysis, was\\xa075.0% and\\xa066.0%, respectively (pooled RR [95%\\xa0CI]\\xa0=\\xa01.11\\xa0[0.69–1.78], p\\xa0=\\xa00.66) whereas in the PP analysis it was\\xa085.7% and\\xa070.0% (pooled RR [95%\\xa0CI]\\xa0=\\xa01.20\\xa0[0.82–1.75], p\\xa0=\\xa00.34). Although P-CAB-based salvage therapy tended to be superior to PPI-based salvage therapy with respect to eradication efficacy, the difference was not statistically significant in either the ITT or PP analysis, although in both analyses the heterogeneity was significant (I2\\xa0=\\xa073% and\\xa069%, respectively).\\nA subgroup analysis was performed according to whether the study was conducted in Japan or in other countries (Figure 5, Figure 6). In the subgroup of Japanese studies, the forest plot analysis showed significant superiority of P-CAB- over PPI-based regimens in terms of the overall success of H. pylori eradication, in both the ITT analysis (pooled eradication rate\\xa0=\\xa089.6%\\xa0vs.\\xa073.9%; RR [95%\\xa0CI]\\xa0=\\xa01.21\\xa0[1.14–1.29], p < 0.01) and PP analysis (pooled eradication rate\\xa0=\\xa092.0%\\xa0vs.\\xa075.7%; RR [95%\\xa0CI]\\xa0=\\xa01.18\\xa0[1.06–1.32], p < 0.01). Significant heterogeneity was identified in the PP analysis (I2\\xa0=\\xa057%) but not in the ITT analysis (I2\\xa0=\\xa045%). However, in the subgroup consisting of studies from other countries, the eradication efficacy of P-CAB-based therapy was not superior to that of PPI-based therapy, in either the ITT analysis (pooled eradication rate\\xa0=\\xa093.8%\\xa0vs.\\xa085.2%; RR [95%\\xa0CI]\\xa0=\\xa01.10\\xa0[0.99–1.22], p\\xa0=\\xa00.07) or PP analysis (pooled eradication rate\\xa0=\\xa095.0%\\xa0vs.\\xa090.8%; RR [95%\\xa0CI]\\xa0=\\xa01.05 [0.98–1.14], p\\xa0=\\xa00.17). There was also no significant heterogeneity (I2\\xa0=\\xa00%).\\nAll included studies provided detailed information regarding adverse events, but only four reported the overall incidence thereof, which was\\xa033.6% for P-CAB-based therapy and\\xa040.0% for PPI-based therapy. There was no difference in the rate of adverse events between the two regimens (RR [95%\\xa0CI]\\xa0=\\xa00.84 [0.71–1.00], p\\xa0=\\xa00.05), nor was there significant heterogeneity (I2\\xa0=\\xa07%), as shown in Figure\\xa07. Among the included studies, four reported that adverse events caused seven and four patients receiving P-CAB- and PPI-based regimens to stop treatment, respectively. One of the four studies reported that four serious adverse events occurred in patients receiving P-CAB-based therapy, and two in those receiving PPI-based therapy. In the other three studies, no patient experienced a serious adverse event or side effect leading to treatment discontinuation. The overall incidence of serious adverse events was\\xa00.67%\\xa0among patients in the P-CAB-based therapy group and\\xa00.35% among those in the PPI-based therapy group; the difference was not significant (p\\xa0=\\xa00.44); (Fig. S1). The pooled dropout rate due to adverse events was\\xa01.2% in P-CAB-treated patients and\\xa00.7% in PPI-treated patients. There was no significant difference in the dropout rate between the two regimens, nor was there significant heterogeneity (RR [95%\\xa0CI]\\xa0=\\xa01.53\\xa0[0.51‒4.63], p\\xa0=\\xa00.67, I2\\xa0=\\xa00%); (Fig. S2). The most common adverse events were diarrhea, dysgeusia, abdominal fullness, abdominal pain, anorexia, nausea, headache, and belching.\\nThe current regimen approved for H. pylori eradication combines a PPI and two antibiotics, with or without bismuth. However, the success of this regimen has been limited, mostly due to antibiotic resistance and insufficient gastric acid suppression. The advantages of a P-CAB-containing eradication regimen include rapid onset of action, long-duration acid suppression, less interindividual variation in acid suppression, and a minimal influence of diet on its action. Thus, with P-CAB-based therapies, the eradication rate is expected to be higher than that achieved by conventional regimens using a standard dose of a PPI. To date, the most commonly used P-CAB has been VPZ, administered in Japanese populations, although other P-CABs have been tested in other Asian countries.\\nThe present study's meta-analysis revealed a higher eradication rate with P-CAB- than with PPI-based triple therapy, as determined in an ITT analysis (89.0%\\xa0vs.\\xa074.2%) and PP analysis (89.0%\\xa0vs.\\xa074.2%). These results are consistent with a previous meta-analysis that reported eradication rates of\\xa087.9% for VPZ-based therapy and\\xa072.8% for PPI-based therapy. The superiority of VPZ was demonstrated in a subgroup analysis of treatment-naïve patients. The results showed that this P-CAB was superior to PPIs when administered to treatment-naive patients as first-line triple therapy (eradication rate\\xa0=\\xa091.8%\\xa0vs.\\xa076.4% in the ITT analysis and 93.0%\\xa0vs.\\xa078.6% in the PP analysis). Specifically, the eradication rate of P-CAB-containing first-line therapy was\\xa0> 90%, which implies high efficacy and accords with the recommendations of currently available guidelines. By contrast, the eradication rate of PPI-based therapy is\\xa0< 80%, which is considered unacceptable. The potent acid-inhibitory effect of P-CABs may explain its high efficacy. In a previous meta-analysis, high-dose PPIs were shown to be more effective than standard-dose PPPIs for eradicating H. pylori infection, because the increased gastric pH may drive H. pylori to re-enter the replicative state and thus become susceptible to antibiotics. However, in salvage therapy, clarithromycin is replaced by metronidazole or sitafloxacin. With this regimen, there was no significant difference in eradication rate between P-CAB-containing and PPI-containing triple therapy, either in the ITT analysis (75.0%\\xa0vs.\\xa066.0%, p\\xa0=\\xa00.66) or PP analysis (85.7%\\xa0vs.\\xa070.0%, p\\xa0=\\xa00.34). These findings are consistent with a previous study, in which the efficacy of P-CABs (VPZ) was superior to that of PPIs as first-line H. pylori eradication therapy in patients infected with either clarithromycin-susceptible or clarithromycin-resistant strains. However, VPZ was not superior to PPIs as second-line triple eradication therapy. This lack of a difference may be due to the fact that the efficacy of acid inhibitors is an important factor in the context of clarithromycin therapy, but not metronidazole or sitafloxacin therapy. Contrary findings were presented in a previous meta-analysis of retrospective studies, in which VPZ-based regimens were shown to be significantly superior to PPI-based regimens as second-line H. pylori eradication therapy. In the present study's salvage therapy subgroup, the small number and significant heterogeneity of the included studies limited the level of evidence.\\nP-CABs for H. pylori eradication is mainly used in Japan, such that most studies included Japanese patients. Therefore, to examine the efficacy of P-CABs in patients from other countries, the authors conducted another subgroup analysis according to country. In the subgroup of patients from Japan, a higher H. pylori eradication rate was obtained with the P-CAB- than the PPI-based regimen, in both the ITT analysis (89.6%\\xa0vs.\\xa093.9%) and PP analysis (92.0%\\xa0vs.\\xa075.7%). However, this was not the case in the subgroup of patients from countries other than Japan, as the difference between the two treatment groups was not significant either in the ITT analysis (p\\xa0=\\xa00.07) or PP analysis (p\\xa0=\\xa00.17). However, because the two studies in this subgroup had small sample sizes, the results need to be interpreted with caution.\\nIn the present meta-analysis, the safety of P-CABs and PPIs as H. pylori eradication therapies was also assessed. There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of the incidence of adverse or serious adverse events. Nonetheless, the dropout rate related to adverse events was lower in the P-CAB than the PPI group. Therefore, the safety and tolerance of P-CAB-containing H. pylori eradication therapies are acceptable.\\nAlthough the present study's meta-analysis demonstrated the benefit of P-CAB-based eradication therapy, it had several limitations. First, all of the included studies were performed in Asian countries; the lack of data from European and American countries may have led to selection bias, given that regional differences in diets and genetics influence gastric pH. Second, the number of studies and sample sizes used to analyze the difference between P-CABs and PPIs as salvage therapy, and in countries other than Japan, was limited. Third, the role of antibiotic (e.g., clarithromycin) resistance was not assessed. Fourth, different antibiotics were used for salvage therapy. Lastly, only conventional triple therapies provided for\\xa07-days were compared in the meta-analysis; alternative therapeutic strategies were not considered. Large RCTs conducted in multiple regions and countries are necessary to confirm the authors’ findings.\\nIn summary, a comparison of the efficacy of first-line H. pylori triple eradication therapies showed that P-CABs were superior to PPI. The present meta-analysis also highlighted that the superiority of P-CABs was mainly driven by studies conducted in Japan. However, P-CABs were not superior to PPIs as a salvage triple eradication therapy. In addition, the present study showed that the safety of P-CABs for H. pylori eradication is comparable to PPIs. Nevertheless, as some of the authors’ conclusions were based on small samples with significant heterogeneity, they should be interpreted with caution. Further large-scale RCTs are needed to validate the present findings.\\nZhang Mengran: Concept, design, literature search, data collection and/or processing; analysis and/or interpretation; writing manuscript.\\nPang Mingge: Literature search, data collection and/or processing.\\nZhang Mei: Concept, design, supervision, resources, critical review.\\nThe authors declare no conflicts of interest.\"},\n",

       "    'fulltext': 'Cancer is one of the major public health concerns in today’s world, especially in developed countries, where it holds second place—just after cardiovascular diseases—in the list of leading causes of death. In 2019, 17.83% of total deaths were attributed to malignant neoplasms, for all ages and both sexes, compared to the data registered for 1990 (12.34%). For example, in the European Union, this figure increases up to 29% of total deaths in 2019, contrary to the trend found for heart and circulatory diseases. This is one of the main reasons why the biomedical scientific community devotes great effort to finding novel approaches to treat different types of cancer more efficiently, while reducing their associated systemic toxicity. The case of gastric cancer draws attention: there are different regions of the world that can be considered endemic areas for this pathology, mainly due to high exposure to various risk factors, the most relevant being infection by Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori).\\nH. pylori (initially named Campylobacter pyloridis, and later known as Campylobacter pylori before its current taxonomical classification) is a Gram-negative bacterium whose very name reveals some other details about its morphology and trophism: the genus Helicobacter refers to its shape (of a curved rod), while pylori is reminiscent of the pylorus (the opening that connects the stomach and the duodenum, alluding to where the pathogen can settle). It is selectively trophic for the gastric mucosa and its optimal living conditions require lower-than-atmospheric levels of oxygen (microaerophilia). It is also capable of forming water-insoluble biofilms under certain conditions.\\nUsual therapeutic approaches against this bacterium fall into one of these groups: (a) empiric therapies and (b) susceptibility-based therapies. In any case, the efficacy of current anti-H. pylori clinical regimens is deficient and following a worrying decreasing trend that can be confirmed by looking at global data on resistance to key antibiotics. Although amoxicillin appears to be the drug to which H. pylori presents the least overall resistance, strains resistant to this and other antibiotics are rapidly becoming predominant, making the development of novel and optimized therapies a matter of utmost urgency. Both the discovery of new regimen-enhancing drugs (such as vonoprazan fumarate) and the generation of smart formulations that improve overall pharmacokinetics have been discussed as potential options to expand the available set of options for H. pylori eradication.\\nThis work focuses on reviewing the clinical and biological characteristics of H. pylori, especially its link with gastric cancer. Current approaches aimed at improving of the therapeutic repertoire against H. pylori will be assessed, and the use of amoxicillin and vonoprazan as a possible dual-cargo option will be considered. In this sense, the works dealing with the development of floating and/or mucoadhesive drug delivery systems for sustained release of amoxicillin cargo will also be reviewed.\\nIn the present review, the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology was used. Searches for scientific papers on the subject in English were carried out in databases such as Google Scholar, Web of Science, Mendeley, Microsoft Academic, Worldwide Science, Science Direct, IEEE Xplore, Springer Link, Scopus, PubMed. The terms used in the research search varied depending on the theme to review (as detailed below) and a general inclusion criterion was applied regarding the research areas of the scientific bibliography: pharmacology pharmacy, infectious diseases, gastroenterology, materials science, chemistry, biochemistry molecular biology, microbiology, science technology, toxicology, polymer science, oncology. In a first step, the abstracts of the publications were analyzed to identify the publications to be reviewed with their full text. In a second step, for the selected articles, a detailed reading of the text and its conclusions was conducted. Other works that were not found in the first search but that were of great interest to the present review and referred to by the selected works were included.\\nThus, in the section related to gastric cancer, studies focused on reviewing the status quo of this disease have been included. The terms used for the search were (only applying to title and/or abstract): gastric cancer AND (statistics OR epidemiology OR prevalence) OR “risk factors” OR “Helicobacter pylori”. This search was refined by the following inclusion criteria: (a) publication year: from 2022 to 2015, both included, and (b) document type: review. Only the most relevant publications were analyzed. In the section related to characterization of H. pylori, publications centered on biological and clinical characteristics were included. The terms used for the search were (only applying to title and/or abstract): “Helicobacter pylori” AND characteristics AND infection AND (metabolism OR epidemiology OR physiopathology OR genetics OR “virulence factors” OR “clinical history”). This search was refined by the following inclusion criteria: (a) publication year: from 2022 to 2015, both included. In the section regarding antibiotic-based therapeutic approaches against H. pylori, articles related to precedents of therapies used to treat this pathogen were included. The terms used for the search were (only applying to title and/or abstract): (“therapeutic approaches” OR therapy) AND “Helicobacter pylori” AND infection AND (empiric OR susceptibility) AND antibiotic. This search was refined by the following inclusion criteria: (a) publication year: from 2022 to 2015, and (b) document type: review. Only the most relevant publications were analyzed. In the section about amelioration of drug combinations, articles focusing on vonoprazan fumarate were included. The terms used for the search were (only applying to title and/or abstract): (“vonoprazan fumarate” OR vonoprazan) AND “Helicobacter pylori”. Only the most relevant publications were analyzed. In the sections related to the development of smart, gastroretentive drug delivery systems, studies were included on the use of amoxicillin in Helicobacter pylori infections, treatment and formulations, or sustained release of drugs. Formulations in which the antibiotics employed were clarithromycin and metronidazole were excluded. The terms used for the search were: “amoxicillin AND (Helicobacter OR pylori) AND (“drug release” OR “sustained drug release” OR GRDDS OR formulation) NOT (clarithromycin OR metronidazole)”. This search was refined by the following inclusion criteria: (a) publication year: from 2022 to 2010, both included, (b) document type: articles.\\nIt has been estimated that 26,560 new cases of gastric cancer were diagnosed in the United Stated in 2021, more predominantly in males than females, while 11,180 people were predicted to die that same year. This positions stomach neoplasms above laryngeal, ovarian, or esophageal cancer, but with a lower incidence than leukemia, melanoma, or prostate cancer. Moreover, the five-year relative survival rate for gastric cancer (at all stages, in this same country) was estimated to be around 32% based on data collected between 2010 and 2016. This figure is low compared to other types of cancer such as colon (63%), kidney (75%), melanoma (93%), prostate (98%), or breast cancer (90%). These differences may be related to the fact that the prognosis of this disease is generally poor, being diagnosed in most cases at a late stage, when treatment is not as effective as otherwise desired.\\nSome of the risk factors that have been reported for gastric neoplasms are smoking, occupational hazards (rubber industry), exposure to ionizing radiation or asbestos, partial gastrectomy, some genetic polymorphisms, factors related to diet, and infection by Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), the latter being the most relevant for the prevention of gastric cancer. Epstein–Barr virus infection and high levels of N-nitroso compounds in the body have also been linked to an increased risk of developing this type of neoplasm. Aspirin intake, on the other hand, has been proposed to have a protective role against it. Whether there is a relationship between gastric cancer and peptic ulcers has always been a matter of controversy. Nevertheless, it is known that H. pylori infection is not only considered a risk factor for gastric cancer but is also strongly associated with the appearance of other gastric and duodenal ulcer diseases, as reported in 1996. The authors stated that atrophic gastritis associated with H. pylori could evolve into stomach neoplasms or gastric ulcer disease—and, therefore, both pathologies possibly having etiological factors in common—while also establishing that some of the clinical particularities associated with duodenal ulcers could serve as protective factors for gastric cancer. In any case, the finding of a stomach ulcer may reveal ongoing colonization of the gastric mucosa by H. pylori, indicating an increased risk of the patient’s cells undergoing oncological transformation.\\nSurprisingly, there are only a few prevention programs for gastric cancer, mainly in East Asia, where this type of neoplasm is highly prevalent. This has obvious historical roots (for instance, differences in dietary factors have been shown to greatly affect the development of gastric cancer) and is therefore linked to what each nation prioritizes medically. For example, the Spanish National Healthcare System provides free screening services for breast cancer (biannual mammography, for women between 50 and 69 years of age since 1990) or for colorectal cancer (biannual fecal occult blood test, for men and women between 50 and 69 years of age, since 2014), which coincides with the fact that the country has high rates for both types of cancer. Conversely, to date, no gastric cancer prevention program has been established in Spain, probably because it does not have such a big impact on society, leading to underdiagnosis of gastric cancer.\\nIn contrast, Portugal, a country that shares all its borders with Spain, behaves differently in terms of stomach cancer, although, a priori, similar rates could be expected for both countries. The recently developed Iberian cancer ‘cartography’ suggests that both countries differ markedly when comparing relative risk of stomach cancer mortality, as if the border served as an impenetrable barrier for risk factors (Figure 1). In fact, and even though their societies are strongly tied by land, gastric cancer was the 3rd in Portugal, but the 7th in Spain, in terms of mortality in 2018. Therefore, this is an example of how different environmental exposures and ways of living have a crucial bearing on mortality records.\\nIn any case, the analysis of the evolution of gastric cancer in recent decades (Figure 2) shows that the regions in which the death rates attributed to this disease have exceeded the world average are Asia and Europe (both in the European Union and in Eastern Europe). In fact, these regions may be considered as large endemic areas for gastric cancer. As stated before, poor hygiene standards (especially in developing countries, where H. pylori contamination is common), smoking, high alcohol intake, or diets poor in vegetables and greens and rich in smoked and salty food are factors that could justify these data. Nonetheless, the global incidence shows a downward trend in the last few years, most likely because of the improvement in hygienic and sanitary conditions worldwide, the progress in food transportation, the promotion of diets rich in vitamin C and fiber, the development of salt-free food preservation methods, and antibiotic treatments against H. pylori. Even so, the situation in countries such as Japan is different, where the number of people who died from gastric cancer exceeded the global average by three times in 2019, or Portugal and China, where it almost doubled. The world in general, and these nations in particular, would benefit immensely from any progress in selective therapies against gastric cancer, or more conveniently, from improved diagnostic approaches for its early detection. Furthermore, and considering that H. pylori is the main causal agent of this disease, it is also crucial research aiming at detecting its presence in the gastric mucosa as soon as possible and, if that was the case, eliminating it efficiently.\\nLastly, gastric cancer can be classified clinically according to several parameters, with the Lauren classification being the most widely used. According to this sorting, there are two main subtypes of gastric cancer—intestinal and diffuse—which differ in genetic characteristics, morphology, epidemiology, or clinical behavior. These differences have an impact on surgical and therapeutic decisions, and therefore, the characterization of each case is an essential need for the practicing gastroenterologist. Moreover, it is important to consider that therapies in development, when in clinical and in vitro trials, should be tested against as many types of cancer cells as possible.\\nThe proteome of Helicobacter pylori is characterized by the production of catalase, oxidase, and urease, the latter being essential for its survival when infecting humans. Urease is an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of gastric urea into carbon dioxide and ammonia, the latter being responsible for the partial neutralization of gastric acid. By doing so, the pathogen ensures its protection against the harsh environment around it when infecting the stomach (it can only survive when its periplasmic pH is ≥4), so enhancing its biological success. H. pylori also presents several flagella polarly distributed, thanks to which the pathogen can delve into the gastric wall and reach deeper areas underneath the mucus and, thus, avoid direct exposure to the acidic lumen. This all justifies the fact that one of the most impressive characteristics attributed to this bacterium is its ability to persist in the gastric mucosa for years after the first contact, thanks both to these pathogenic mechanisms and to the inability of the patient to eradicate the infection effectively. Indeed, there is evidence supporting that colonization of humans by H. pylori has been happening for at least 58,000 years, meaning this microorganism has coexisted with our species for thousands of years, probably evolving complementarily.\\nClinically, the metabolic transformation of urea by H. pylori urease is one of the hallmarks chosen to reliably diagnose this infection, i.e., by the urea breath test. Considering that mammalian cells do not secrete urease, and that bacteria other than H. pylori are not usually present in the stomach, exhalation of 13C-CO2 (or 14C-CO2) will only be detected when 13C-urea (or 14C-urea, respectively) is administered to the patients that are colonized by H. pylori.\\nThis bacterium was first cultured in the early 1980s by Australian researchers Barry Marshall and Robin Warren (eventually awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine because of this achievement), who isolated it from human gastric biopsies. Previously, the scientific community had reported the existence of spiral bacteria in the stomach epithelium which were capable of surviving those extremely acidic conditions. Nonetheless, it was not until recent years when its colonization of the organ was linked to pathologies related to the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) such as chronic gastritis, peptic ulceration, gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma (MALToma) and gastric adenocarcinoma. For several years H. pylori was argued to be part of the commensal microbiome of the human species but, considering that all patients infected with it characteristically present an easily recognizable histological pattern of persistent gastric inflammation, it should no longer be regarded as just ordinary flora. Main physio-pathological events associated with an infection by this pathogen are represented in Figure 3. Furthermore, it has been reported that this bacterium can wreak havoc in non-GIT regions because it can be involved in the development of iron and/or cobalamin deficiency, or even idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura.\\nThese data are relevant since infection by this bacterium is highly prevalent worldwide (over 50% of the world population are supposed to host it), especially in certain developing regions where sanitary conditions may not be optimal. For example, Africa scores the highest prevalence of H. pylori infection among the continents (approximately 70% of the population studied), whereas Australasia has the lowest rates (around 24%). Interestingly, despite the African figures, Figure 2 reveals that Africa ranks last in terms of gastric cancer cases among the regions studied. This fact may be related to the dietary trends of its population and/or to the fact that it is the region with the lowest life expectancy at birth in the world.\\nAlthough many of the infected individuals do not develop any medical symptoms and enjoy a normal life, any individual carrying this pathogen is predisposed, even if slightly, to develop H. pylori-related gastric imbalances that could range from mildest alterations of the stomach mucosa to life-threatening oncological events. In fact, following these discoveries, H. pylori was categorized as a group 1 carcinogen in 1994 by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (part of the World Health Organization, WHO), and it is considered one of the most common etiological agents for infection-related neoplasms. Several studies have already demonstrated that the risk for gastric adenocarcinoma increases when this bacterium is present in the GIT. It has been estimated that 1–3% of infected patients will eventually develop gastric adenocarcinoma. The latter, in turn, depends on the development of atrophic gastritis after the colonization of the pathogen, its prevalence varying greatly between different areas of the globe. Indeed, a direct relationship has been established between the presence of the pathogen in the stomach and consequent tumoral transformation in regions such as Europe or Japan, where H. pylori-positive gastric cancer cases counted for more than 93% and 99% of the total, respectively.\\nTherefore, eradication of H. pylori is today a primary therapeutic objective when detected in the patient’s body, since its elimination significantly changes the natural history of the disease and prevents the escalation of overall risk for stomach neoplasms. Meeting this objective will mean not only a decrease in the incidence of gastric cancer, but also in medical costs, with the consequent benefit for national healthcare systems which will be able to redirect funds towards other critical health needs. In addition, it has been reported that H. pylori-related MALToma can be completely cured if pathogen colonization is promptly detected and stopped, thus it is considered as the first clonal lesion that can be eliminated with the prescribing of an antibiotic-based therapy.\\nRegarding the epidemiology of H. pylori infection, most colonization begins during childhood, both through interpersonal transmission within families (oral-oral, gastro-oral, or fecal-oral transmission routes), or by intake of foodstuff that was in contact with contaminated sources (food grown in infected soil, H. pylori-infected water, etc.), and can persist for decades unless treated. Since gastric cancer and H. pylori infections are connected, the rapid decline in H. pylori transmission rates—by the amelioration of the factors mentioned above—has led to a reduction in cases of gastric cancer and other H. pylori-related diseases in the Western world today.\\nSeveral genomically diverse strains of H. pylori have been classified. To correctly determine the patient’s prognosis, it is essential to identify the main bacterial virulence factors present in the infection. These factors are variable due to the genetic heterogeneity of the microorganism, and most of them are known to have evolved to disrupt host cell signaling pathways. Of note is that the medical outcome of the patient will not only vary depending on these strain-specific factors; the interaction established between the pathogen and the patient’s immune system, as well as possible environmental influences, are also relevantly involved.\\nFocusing on bacterial virulence factors, some of them have already been discussed above (production of urease, helical bacterial morphology, flagella-dependent motility). Yet there are others with different functions that can also be highlighted. The expression of proteins such as the blood group antigen-binding adhesin (BabA), the sialic acid-binding adhesin (SabA), or the outer inflammatory protein (OipA) on the pathogen’s outer membrane facilitates its binding to the stomach epithelium and later colonization. These proteins potentiate the damaging of the mucosal layer. The H. pylori outer membrane protein (HopQ) and the CagY factor are known to act as immune regulators by inhibiting immune activity against the bacterium. On the other hand, the Cag-pathogenicity island (cagPAI) is one of the most relevant virulence elements found in the genome of H. pylori. Among other actions, this chromosome region encodes for a multicomponent bacterial type IV secretion system (T4SS) and for an effector protein called CagA, the latter being responsible for the most aggressive behaviors of highly virulent H. pylori strains. T4SS is necessary for the translocation of CagA into the gastric epithelial cells, where it will widely manifest itself once phosphorylated by cellular kinases. Thus, T4SS acts as a syringe that injects CagA into the stomach epithelium, causing cell elongation and proliferation and promoting expression of proinflammatory IL-8. The vacuolating cytotoxin (VacA) is also responsible for the pathogenicity associated with H. pylori when interacting with gastric epithelial cells. Some authors have reported that VacA has pore-forming properties, and is also capable of triggering vacuole formation, cell death (both apoptotic and necrotic), and modification of the autophagic route in the targeted cells. Other relevant virulence causes typically found in H. pylori are (a) the high-temperature requirement protein (HtrA), which acts as a chaperone and a protease protecting the pathogen from misfolded proteins and collaborating in the intracellular delivery of CagA, and (b) the cholesterol glycosyl-transferase (CGT), which destroys lipid rafts of infected cells and protects bacteria from inflammatory response.\\nCurrently, antibiotic-based therapies against this pathogen are not foolproof whatsoever, especially considering the dramatic increase in antibiotic-resistant H. pylori strains. Thus, for example, some studies point out that it is not possible to eradicate the bacteria in at least 2 out of 10 patients treated, which may not seem very relevant, but it really is, even more so when resistance to antibiotics is rising exponentially in some parts of the world. This increase in antibiotic resistance is probably due to the use of combined antibiotic therapies that have been routinely prescribed when H. pylori was detected in the patient’s stomach.\\nRecent reviews on the treatment of H. pylori classify the therapies against this pathogen into two groups: (a) empiric therapies and (b) susceptibility-based therapies. The former is usually prescribed when the specific clinical characteristics of the strain infecting the patient are not reported, so their objective is to be effective for as broad a spectrum as possible. These typically include either bismuth-containing compounds (as in PeptoBismol®, a common commercial brand for bismuth subsalicylate sold in the United States) or rifabutin. Bismuth subsalicylate is frequently used to treat gastrointestinal unwellness (such as traveler’s diarrhea or peptic ulcers) because it effectively displays antiacid and anti-inflammatory properties while being relatively inexpensive. Bismuth salts are also interesting when dealing with digestive problems because their low solubility enables them to exert a mainly local action, thus avoiding systemic absorption. On the other hand, bismuth subsalicylate can cause side effects in patients such as black hairy tongue syndrome or neurological toxicity when its accumulation occurs, mainly in prolonged treatment. Nonetheless, it has been proven to be useful when it comes to stopping colonization by H. pylori; it can act as an antimicrobial agent on its own, suppressing the proliferation of the pathogen but not eliminating it. In this way, if combined with the appropriate antibiotics, the overall effect can be the total eradication of colonizing bacteria. Indeed, some studies have reported histologic improvement and overall amelioration of symptoms after prescribing these multiple-drug therapies. Characteristically, empiric bismuth-based therapy is the result of combining a bismuth-containing compound with two antibiotics (tetracycline and metronidazole) plus a proton pump inhibitor (for example, omeprazole or esomeprazole). Other medical prescriptions may include bismuth citrate instead of bismuth subsalicylate and the results are likely to be similar. In any case, this tactic is regarded as a first-line treatment option for areas where antibiotic resistance is known to be high, especially those with mark resistance to clarithromycin. Still, bismuth-based quadruple therapy is generally ruled out in countries such as Japan, Australia, or Malaysia when treating H. pylori because of its side effects. Rifabutin is an antitubercular drug sold under the brand Talicia®. These delayed-release capsules also contain omeprazole magnesium (high dose) and amoxicillin, making them suitable triple therapy against H. pylori. This combination is believed to be advantageous compared to others because resistance to rifabutin is rare. Nevertheless, overall high-quality scientific evidence for this combination has not been established. Special caution is recommended in the use of rifabutin-containing therapies to avoid both the flourishing of resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and the risk of myelotoxicity.\\nOn the other hand, susceptibility-based therapies generally include three drugs and are indicated if sensibility to specific antibiotics is known after testing the strain infecting the patient. This therapeutic option should not be chosen in any other case to avoid further resistance issues, let alone as empiric therapies, especially considering how high resistance levels already are for the key antibiotics in these combinations. This type of triple prescription usually includes one proton pump inhibitor and two antibiotics, typically clarithromycin plus one of amoxicillin, levofloxacin, or metronidazole, based on bacterial culture data. Fluoroquinolones are known to pose a high risk of dire side effects; in fact, the FDA issued multiple warnings between 2008 and 2018 alerting about its use. Therefore, the choice of levofloxacin to treat H. pylori is only recommended as a last resort, mainly when the infecting strain is resistant to other antibiotics.\\nMost of the antibiotics included in anti-H. pylori triple therapies require an increase of intragastric pH to function effectively as a bactericidal agent, justifying the addition of a proton pump inhibitor to the combination. Although the addition of the latter can be counterintuitive since the basification of intragastric pH will also make the pathogen proliferate, antibiotics such as amoxicillin need this bacterial growth and take advantage of it. The mechanism of action of amoxicillin and clarithromycin involves targeting a biomolecules that are essential for the bacterial growth phase (either penicillin-binding proteins or 23S rRNA within the 50S subunit of bacterial ribosomes, respectively). This is the reason why these eradication treatments are expected to be successful when the pH inside the stomach rises, since a bigger fraction of the bacteria will be prone to division (thus having greater sensitivity to these antibiotics) instead of remaining inactive (thus resisting antibiotics). It has also been reported that proton pump inhibitors have antimicrobial activity against H. pylori per se, and may even hinder its urease activity, causing the prescription of these compounds to evolve from simple administration for symptomatic relief to actually help enhance the overall pharmacologic attack. All in all, medical data seem to support the idea that the synergy between proton pump inhibitors and antibiotics is necessary (or at least beneficial) for the elimination of H. pylori.\\nAnother important aspect to bear in mind is that most of the anti-H. pylori chemicals described above (metronidazole, levofloxacin, and clarithromycin) can be classified as concentration-dependent drugs, i.e., the extent of microorganism elimination is a function of the antimicrobial concentration (they will have a more powerful effect the higher their concentration gets). In contrast, amoxicillin stands out as a time-dependent drug in this pathology, thus being more effective the longer its concentration surpasses the established minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) for H. pylori. Therefore, regarding amoxicillin, instead of aiming to achieve higher drug levels of the drug, attention should be focused on prolonging the time interval in which the antibiotic concentration remains above MIC, since this is the only PK-PD parameter that correlates with the efficacy of beta-lactam antibiotics. Taking advantage of this unique characteristic of amoxicillin may be crucial to improve current therapeutical approaches when treating H. pylori colonization.\\nOn another front, for both empiric and susceptibility-based therapies, optimal anti-H. pylori treatment lasts 7 to 14 days. These treatments are typically longer in the United States (10–14 days) than in Europe or Asia (weeklong approaches). Although susceptibility-based approaches are preferred due to their more targeted antibiotic usage, advances in these therapies must be accompanied by improvements in methods for assessing antibiotic resistance of infecting strains. Today, only a few techniques, including cultures or polymerase chain reactions, are available to determine it. Furthermore, susceptibility results do not necessarily translate to complete elimination of the bacteria in vivo. Indeed, a 2020 meta-analysis concluded that the evidence is insufficient to discourage empirical regimens in routine clinical practice and make susceptibility-guided treatment the mainstream of future therapy, at least until susceptibility testing is optimized and globally accessible. Results of opposite cost-effectiveness (in favor of the empirical method) and similar efficacy between the two therapeutic approaches have also been found. Consequently, the development of inexpensive and readily available tests to determine antibiotic resistance appears to be essential for susceptibility-based therapies to become first-line treatment in H. pylori infection.\\nOther pharmacological treatments, such as concomitant, hybrid, and sequential therapies, have been attempted in recent years but are no longer recommended due to mounting evidence showing little success.\\nSequential therapy against H. pylori gets its name from the fact that it is based on a two-stage medical regimen: first, one proton pump inhibitor and one antibiotic (usually amoxicillin) are prescribed for 5 to 7 days; and second, amoxicillin is replaced by two other antibiotics (such as clarithromycin and metronidazole) and medication is continued for an additional 5 to 7 days. Sometimes a fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin) is also included the second course of medication. In essence, it can be seen as quadruple therapy, or even triple therapy if amoxicillin is repeated in the second period. Evidence regarding greater success of this therapeutical approach compared to others is limited, contradictory, and often regarded as low-quality. Indeed, as of 2017, the FDA had not approved this therapeutical regimen. Overall, sequential therapy has been relegated to a conditional first-line choice, but only in certain geographic areas and under specific circumstances (i.e., to treat patients infected with single clarithromycin-resistant strain), and without substantial evidence in any case.\\nConcomitant H. pylori therapy (also known as non-bismuth quadruple therapy) is prescribed for 10 days and contains three antibiotics (amoxicillin, clarithromycin, and metronidazole), with the hope that the infecting strain is sensible to, at least, one of them. One bismuth-free proton pump inhibitor is also prescribed. The number of pills to be taken by the patients is greater than normal, which makes optimal adherence to this approach more cumbersome than in the other cases. Out of the all the discouraged options, concomitant therapy is the one that can still be seen in use today, even being recommended as an alternative first-treatment choice in areas where the prescription of bismuth derivatives is not allowed, or clarithromycin resistance is prevalent. Some studies have even reported concomitant therapy to be equal or more effective than standard triple therapies or sequential approaches when dealing with H. pylori. Nonetheless, in the case of concomitant therapy, treatment costs are higher and a disproportionate exposure of patients to multiple antibiotics is promoted. A 2020 meta-analysis reported that the efficacy of bismuth-containing quadruple treatment surpasses that of concomitant therapy, therefore making the former an equally efficient alternative to the latter with fewer antibiotics.\\nHybrid therapy against H. pylori consists of two dosing periods of 7 days each; the first includes one proton pump inhibitor and amoxicillin, while during the second one two more antibiotics (clarithromycin and a nitroimidazole) are added. Several studies have been conducted comparing the efficacy of hybrid therapy to sequential or concomitant therapies, and none of them have reported significant differences. A 2015 meta-analysis noted that this therapeutical regimen appeared to be more successful and equally tolerable than clarithromycin-based 7-day triple therapy, leading the American College of Gastroenterology to suggest it as an alternative treatment in some cases. Hybrid therapy efficacy in areas with high clarithromycin and metronidazole resistance (such as some Mediterranean countries) has also been reported.\\nIn summary, medical prescriptions have included up to four drugs—of which, usually, two or three are antibiotics—with the aim of eliminating the pathogen without knowing on occasion if it was susceptible to them. The relative success of these packaged therapeutic regimens cannot compensate for the fact that some of the drugs present in these combinations are probably unnecessary, this being a decisive factor for the failure of H. pylori eradication today. Table 1 shows the data on resistance to the main antibiotics used in anti-H. pylori therapies, retrieved from studies carried out in different regions of the world. The information was selected considering the latest and most complete data available for each area. Even though this type of report varies greatly depending on the studied parameters, the increased prevalence of resistance to key antibiotics used in anti-H. pylori therapy is evident, thus limiting the applicability of traditional regimens. This is not a problem unique to H. pylori: a review published in 2020 revealed that more than 80% of the articles studied reported over 60% dispensing of antibiotic without a prescription, which means that the latter is far more common than over-the-counter drug dispensing in other medical fields. This is causing antibiotic resistance to emerge as one of the major health problems worldwide. Optimization of current therapeutic approaches is becoming urgent as the massive flourishing of resistant strains must be stopped. Thus, in rethinking this issue, the medical community must be concerned with (a) reducing the number of antibiotics prescriptions when possible, and (b) adapting antibiotic-based treatments to local resistance patterns.\\nOverall, the outcome obtained after the analysis of the degree of efficacy of anti-H. pylori treatment regarding traditional approaches (especially the triple regimen) are no longer acceptable under the Maastricht consensus, which an anti-H. pylori therapy acknowledged as useful if it is able to achieve an eradication rate of 80% or more.\\nFocusing on the European continent (Table 1), it is surprising to see how disparate the rates of resistance to clarithromycin are between the north and the south of the continent. Some authors correlate this to the different macrolide prescription between countries. The case of Spain is significant, where it was reported that up to 49% of H. pylori strains had lost sensibility to clarithromycin, probably because macrolides were used very loosely in the treatment of infections during the 1990s. In contrast, northern European nations appear to be subject to more stringent regulations, explaining, for example, the emergence of only 1% resistance to clarithromycin in the Netherlands. Some western European countries have also reported to having up to 45% of H. pylori strains resistant to metronidazole, but none of these reach the level seen in the African continent or in some areas of Asia. These differences can be attributed to frequent prescription of metronidazole as an antiparasitic and as a cure for gynecological infections. Analogously, high levofloxacin resistance levels may be related to the recurrent use of fluoroquinolones to treat urinary tract infections. In conclusion, of all the antibiotics analyzed previously, amoxicillin (AMOX) appears to have the lowest prevalence of resistance among H. pylori strains (except in Africa), therefore making it an ideal candidate in optimized dual therapy (amoxicillin and a proton pump inhibitor) to be studied as a first-line treatment for infections in most countries.\\nCurrent anti-H. pylori medical approaches face other problems, one of them being patient adherence to therapy. Since most therapies against H. pylori have so far required the combination of several drugs, the discomfort experienced by the patient due to multiple-pill treatments often reduces compliance. Few studies have been conducted on ways to increase the latter and, thus, optimize clinical outcomes when treating infection by H. pylori. One means is to optimize therapeutic regimens so that the number of pills is minimized while efficacy is maintained. Another possibility is the prescription of formulations such as Talicia®, one capsule that contains all the active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) necessary for the treatment. On the other hand, not only a simpler therapeutic regimen but also the use of drugs with fewer adverse effect would lead patients to fully adhere to the treatment plans. The use of probiotics as beneficial adjuvants in antibiotic treatment has been proposed, since they may reduce certain associated side effects, especially diarrhea. In addition, professional counseling, ongoing follow-up, and comprehensive explanations of the risk-benefit ratio of medication observance are needed to make the patients aware of the importance of adhering to their medication regimen, even when side effects may be uncomfortable.\\nPatient’s ethnic background also plays an important role in the efficacy of the treatment since some polymorphisms are known to impact negatively on therapy success. For example, genetic variations in cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 2C19 (CYP2C19) allow classification of patients into three main groups: extensive metabolizers, intermediate metabolizers, and poor metabolizers. This is relevant because CYP2C19 is the responsible for metabolizing (thereafter, eliminating) proton pump inhibitors, thus altering their pharmacokinetics and drug residence time, and, consequently, determining how high the intragastric pH gets. Therefore, significant differences in gastric acidity between the metabolic groups have been reported. For example, when administering 40 mg of rabeprazole, the pH ranged from 5.9 (among poor metabolizers) to 4.3 (among extensive ones). Loss of function in this enzyme-encoding gene is relatively common, for example, in Thailand, which makes its population predominantly poor metabolizers for drugs such as omeprazole or lansoprazole, thus achieving a more effective inhibition of the secretion of stomach acid, and eventually stopping H. pylori infections more efficiently. In other populations, this issue can be easily solved by using proton pump inhibitors whose efficacy is less likely to be affected by CYP2C19 (such as esomeprazole) or not affected at all (such is the case of the novel drug vonoprazan). Another answer that has been proposed is the prescription of lower but more frequent doses of proton pump inhibitors, even if they are clear targets of CYP2C19; by doing this, intragastric pH was shown to be maintained at significantly less acidic values, regardless of CYP2C19 variations.\\nVariations in interleukin-1β and interleukin-1RN genotypes have also been linked to differences in drug response against H. pylori. These cytokines can act as endogenous inhibitors of gastric acidic secretion, allegedly increasing the likelihood of effective eradication of the bacteria when administering any proton pump inhibitor. In this way, patients with the interleukin-1β-511 T/T genotype have shown higher eradication rates than those with interleukin-1β-511 C/T or C/C genotypes, and the same has been reported for patients with the interleukin-1RN 1/2 genotype in contrast with those with interleukin-1RN 1/1 genotype. All in all, amelioration of therapies against H. pylori is required to overcome these drawbacks.\\nNumerous approaches have been proposed to eliminate H. pylori with probiotic supplementation and phytomedical regimens. Nonetheless, their potential remains to be demonstrated, especially considering that most of the data were obtained from animals or in vitro, but not from humans. Probiotics are administrated in limited amounts to take advantage of their beneficial properties on the gastrointestinal niche, i.e., their anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects. Some research groups have studied the combination of probiotics, such as Saccharomyces boulardii or different Lactobacillus sp. strains, with antibiotics. Even though antibiotic side effects, such as diarrhea, decreased significantly, the eradication rate did not change substantially.\\nMore interestingly, vonoprazan-based therapies have also recently been explored. Vonoprazan fumarate (VONO, also known as TAK-438; hereinafter referred to as “vonoprazan”) is a novel drug that can act as a potassium-competitive acid blocker (P-CAB), that is, a chemical capable of competing with potassium, and reversibly bind to the ATPases found in parietal cells that are responsible for secreting acid to the stomach. It differs from other P-CAB in its chemical structure, with the absence of some moieties found in other P-CABs that are known to be hepatotoxic and blockers of cardiac potassium channels. Pharmacologically, this drug provides a more sustained, robust, and dose-dependent inhibition of gastric acid secretion compared to ordinary proton pump inhibitors. Its accumulation within the canaliculi of the target cells is achieved more fruitfully than that obtained by regular proton pump inhibitors thanks to its enhanced stability in acidic media and its relatively alkaline character (pKa ≈ 9).\\nVONO choice is also advantageous from a pharmacokinetic point of view. Firstly, and contrary to ordinary proton pump inhibitors, it does not act as a prodrug, which explains its quicker, longer-lasting, and more effective suppression of acidic secretion. Indeed, maximum pharmacological effect is reached from the first dose, while proton pump inhibitors require at least 3 days of consistent administration to achieve a steady-state concentration and optimal clinical effects. Secondly, metabolic elimination of vonoprazan has been reported to be mainly linked to CYP3A4/5 enzyme, instead of CYP2C19, the encoding genes of the first ones being more stable among people from different geographical areas. Thus, elimination of vonoprazan is not affected by polymorphisms related to metabolic enzymes (as was the case with regular proton pump inhibitors) and, hence, overall therapeutic outcome is not dependent on interindividual genetic variability. Thirdly, it can be ingested with food or under fasting conditions unlike traditional proton pump inhibitors, which are recommended to be administrated without food to increase their bioavailability. Fourthly, VONO plasma half-life is considerably longer (about 7 h for a 20-mg dose) than that of key proton pump inhibitors (less than 2 h), allowing for a clinical regimen more spaced in time and, hence, more convenient. Lastly, the administration of VONO within a protective coating in not necessary (unlike omeprazole, for example) since its pharmacological activity is not reduced when exposed to gastric acidity, nor are its pharmacokinetics significantly affected by gastric peristalsis. Notably, VONO has been reported to perform efficiently: when monitoring intragastric pH after its administration, pH values remained ≥ 4 for over 24 h post-dose. The main downside of VONO, when compared to proton pump inhibitors, is that it does not exert antimicrobial activity against H. pylori per se. Moreover, elevated incidence of gastric endocrine tumors in rodents has also been reported when exposed to massive doses of VONO. Nevertheless, this should not be a concern for clinical use, especially when considering the propensity of these animals to develop such neoplasms when subjected to acid suppression treatments. It is also likely that the administration of VONO promotes the overgrowth of the intestinal microbiota due to the very nature of its pharmacological activity (suppression of acid secretion), as occurs with proton pump inhibitors.\\nConsequently, VONO is one of the most promising inhibitors of acidic secretion to date. Substitution of conventional proton pump inhibitors by VONO is likely to overcome the limitations of such drugs and improve the effectiveness of anti-H. pylori treatments, while reducing the number of antibiotics in the regimen. This drug was already marketed in Japan in 2015 under the trade name TAKECAB® (co-promoted by Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd. Tokyo, Japan, and Otsuka Pharmaceutical Company Ltd. Tokyo, Japan) and is currently also sold in several Asian and South American countries. Relevantly, in a 2021 clinical trial for H. pylori eradication, VONO-based triple therapy was compared with omeprazole-containing triple therapy. Both success rates and side effects were reported to be similar, but the first option was optimal with a treatment duration of 7 days versus the 14 days required in the other case. Additionally, dual therapy combining low-dose AMOX and VONO has been tested with adequate results. This combination has proven to be not only as safe and tolerable as traditional triple therapy, but also an even more successful treatment in terms of H. pylori eradication and reduction of antibiotics misuse. However, larger-scale studies evaluating it in other populations are needed.\\nRegarding Europe and the United States, clinical trials are being conducted where VONO is the protagonist; most of them focus on monitoring the safety and pharmacokinetic parameters of VONO, or its use as a better therapeutic alternative for gastroesophageal reflux disease. At present, only a few works have investigated its incorporation in treatments for H. pylori-infected patients (and mostly with populations from the UK or France). There has been a delay in conducting clinical trials with VONO in Europe and North America, compared to Asian countries such as Japan. The reason may be due to the lower prevalence of gastric cancer caused by H. pylori in both regions compared to Asia, where this is a pressing medical concern. While there is a need to evaluate vonoprazan-based regimens where populations are mainly made up of members of other ethnic groups and where antimicrobial resistance follows different patterns, the results are not expected to vary significantly from those obtained in Asian countries, according to a study conducted in 2022. In said investigation, a population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed to assess the impact of selected variables on exposure to vonoprazan. The results suggested that variations in weight, age, or race would not have a clinically significant impact on the safety of vonoprazan, and the efficacy and safety data for vonoprazan in Asian countries are expected to be translatable to non-Asian populations. Additionally, the results of a phase III clinical trial that incorporates vonoprazan in commercial formulations in the USA and Europe have recently been published. This study concluded that triple and dual vonoprazan therapies (vonoprazan plus amoxicillin plus clarithromycin, or vonoprazan plus amoxicillin, respectively) were superior to lansoprazole triple therapy (lansoprazole plus amoxicillin plus clarithromycin) in all patients evaluated, especially in those infected with a clarithromycin-resistant H. pylori strain. Furthermore, the side effects associated with any of the pharmacological treatments containing vonoprazan were not greater than those found with classical therapy. These results suggest that commercialization of vonoprazan in Europe and the USA is imminent.\\nTo conclude, in the search of optimal treatments of H. pylori, the choice of amoxicillin as the antibiotic accompanying vonoprazan may be logical, since it is the one with the least global resistance according to recent data (Table 1). Conversely, clarithromycin has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, so its combination with vonoprazan can cause serious metabolic disorders. Consequently, if the AMOX-VONO dual approach proves to be successful, it could be a major step forward in the treatment of H. pylori infections since only a low dose of a single antibiotic would be needed.\\nOther approaches have focused not on the therapeutic compounds prescribed, but on creating drug delivery systems (DDSs) suitable for the optimal administration of target APIs. This is the case of the lipid nanocarriers designed for the encapsulation of clarithromycin, which later were incorporated into microcapsules, in a study published in February 2022. Effective antibiotic release from this gastroretentive and pH-sensitive DDS was achieved, thus offering an alternative to optimize anti-H. pylori treatments. Another example is the amoxicillin-loaded, pectin-coated liposomes developed by Gottesmann and coworkers. Pectin, polysaccharide obtained from apples, has been reported to interact with both porcine gastric mucins (thus making this formulation gastroretentive) and some of the adhesive proteins expressed in the surface of H. pylori (such as BabA, inhibiting them). The system prepared (a) could dock to the stomach mucus, (b) avoided H. pylori colonization by hindering its adhesion to the organ, and (c) killed the remaining bacteria thanks to release of AMOX. These works demonstrate that investigation in gastroretentive drug delivery systems (GRDDSs) is a promising method that can render fine-tuned formulations with appropriate features as will be describe below, even more if considering that the same idea can be expanded to other relevant APIs and other DDSs.\\nAmong the all drugs used, AMOX is probably the most promising one to use in these systems since low amoxicillin-resistant H. pylori strains have been reported worldwide, as stated before. Optimal administration of AMOX would require small and frequent doses considering its time-dependent pharmacodynamic, so its prescription inside a sustained-release DDS could facilitate H. pylori eradication, accelerate clinical amelioration, and promote patient’s adherence to the regimen. Such DDSs include gastroretentive systems, which will be detailed next.\\nOral administration is the most widespread route for drug intake, accounting for about 90% of all therapies prescribed. Oral formulations have several relevant advantages such as (a) allowing easy storage, transport, and administration, (b) being non-invasive, and (c) promoting high patient compliance. Nonetheless, they also display crucial drawbacks, especially when the fluctuating nature of the GIT is considered. Physiological factors (i.e., pH, gastric emptying time, interactions with food, etc.) are known to affect the bioavailability of oral drugs and significantly alter the dose effectiveness.\\nAs mentioned above, H. pylori resides in the gastric mucus layer at the mucosal-epithelial cell interface. The antimicrobial drug access to this site of infection is restricted both from the stomach and the gastric blood supply. Choosing API formulations to exert their action locally has been shown to be better at eradicating this pathogen from the stomach. That is why the scientific effort is fundamentally directed towards the development of formulations that localize the antibiotic of choice in the gastric region to yield greater bioavailability, thus improving therapeutic efficacy.\\nHowever, in the treatment of infections caused by H. pylori, the failure of a single antibiotic therapy could be due to poor stability of the drug in the acidic pH of the stomach, poor permeability of antibiotics across the mucus layer, or even the non-availability of therapeutic antibiotic concentrations at the infection site soon after oral administration of a conventional dosage form. All this adds up to other factors previously discussed in this work, such as the exponential increase in resistant H. pylori strains. Consequently, prolonged local release of drug is needed to diffuse sufficiently to the bacteria and to optimize antibiotic use in this kind of therapy.\\nGastroretentive drug delivery systems (GRDDSs) have emerged as an ideal approach to overcome these challenges, for example, in local treatment of gastric H. pylori infections. They are designed to lengthen the gastric residence time (GRT) and drug release into the bacterial surroundings, thus reducing the frequency of medication and the doses required to cure the patient. Other aspects where GRDDSs can play a key role could be the prolongation of the release of drugs with narrow absorption windows, or the sustained liberation of APIs soluble at acidic media.\\nAmong these GRDDSs, several methodologies have been attempted to improve the sustained and local release of AMOX in the treatment of H. pylori infections, low-density (floating) systems (which include the raft-forming formulations) and mucoadhesive devices being the most promising approaches.\\nThe design of buoyant systems is one of the main approaches to achieve effective GRDDSs, thus having a bulk density lower than that of gastric fluid (1.004 to 1.010 g/mL). The types of systems that have been designed as AMOX-GRDDSs go from floating in situ gelling system to floating beads, bilayer floating tablets, hollow tablets, floating capsular devices obtained by 3D printing, or floating raft systems (FRSs), and floating microballoons/spheres (Table 2).\\nIn general terms, the overall floating behavior of the dosage form can be reached by addition of swelling enhancers or wicking agents, as well as the incorporation of effervescent combinations. Among the methods employed to make AMOX-loaded systems float, the one most frequently used is the inclusion of gas generating combinations (effervescent mixtures), so the formed gas gets entrapped into the formulation. This would lead to increasing the free volume in the system and hence, reduce the overall density of the GRDDS and make it float. These gas forming mixtures usually include a sodium or calcium carbonic acid salt, which can be dissolved in the acidic medium of the stomach and dissociated into their ions. Gastric acidic environment can promote the protonation of these anions (carbonate or bicarbonate anions) to render carbonic acid, that will subsequently decompose into CO2 (gas) and water. Due to the administration of proton pump inhibitors in H. pylori therapies, the pH of the stomach may not be acidic enough to generate the abovementioned reaction and therefore, a proton donor molecule (such as citric acid) is generally included in the formulation.\\nThe most common CO2-generating salts employed in such formulations are sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) in combination with sodium citrate or citric acid. The use of the low-soluble-at-neutral-pH salt CaCO3 is restricted to those systems in which a carboxylate polymer is used. In those cases, not only do the carbonate ions generate CO2, but also the Ca2+ cations act as an ionic cross-linker between the carboxylate groups, improving the final stability of the formulations. For example, CaCO3 was included in the formulation for the formation of AMOX-loaded floating and mucoadhesive sodium alginate-based (NaAlg) microspheres, whereas CaCO3 and citric acid were used for in situ-gelling systems based on gellan gum (G). This methodology has been followed for the design of new approaches in the treatment of H. pylori in which an anionic polymer and CaCO3 are involved; for example, in the preparation of clarithromycin-loaded (CLA) gellan gum-based floating beads or in FRSs loaded with metronidazole (Mz), in which the formulation includes both anionic polymers: G and NaAlg. Furthermore, the formation of gas can stem from the slow evaporation of a volatile solvent enclosed in the formulation; such it is the case of the slow evaporation of dichloromethane in AMOX-loaded microballoons in the drying procedure during their manufacture (Table 2).\\nAnother alternative to impart floatability to AMOX-based formulations is, on the one hand, the use of low-density lipids such as sunflower oil or light mineral oil in oil-entrapped buoyant beads. Moreover, lipids such as glyceryl monostearate (GMS), Precirol® (PRE) and Compritol® (COM) have also been used as floating assistant agents in Mz formulations. On the other hand, the design of hollow devices is aimed for: for example, hollow tablets for the administration of AMOX and CLA, or 3D-printed capsules for the inclusion of a conventional AMOX capsule into it.\\nRegarding floating lag time (FLT), this parameter is close to zero when a hollow device is used, such as either capsular or modular tablets. It was also observed that the use of gas-generating mixtures based on NaHCO3 with citric acid derivatives displayed very short FLTs (≤40 s) compared to systems in which CaCO3 is chosen. This could be related to the slow solubility of the latter, which is enhanced at acidic pH.\\nInterestingly, and to the authors’ knowledge, all the formulations proposed for the manufacture of floating AMOX-loaded GRDDSs incorporate at least two or three additional excipients to guarantee such buoyancy during the expected release tempo, and there is no example in which its floatability is determined by its own microstructure. This excipient-containing approach is costly and has an ecological impact that should be prevented in future GRDDS designs.\\nRegarding AMOX release studies from floating devices, it is notable that the formulations that render the optimal FLT (hollow modular tablets or hollow imprinted devices) are at the same time the ones that exhibit the less effective drug retention, with up to 90% of cumulative drug release within 1.5 h. Conversely, adequate control on AMOX release was found in some cases, with cumulative drug release ranging from 34% to 97% in 8 h. Burst release (>40% in 1 h) is quite common in floating gel systems and, although an initial peak release could be of help to provide the MIC, this parameter must be controlled for the final formulation (Table 2).\\nRemarkably, these release studies were performed almost exclusively at pH 1.2, in either simulated gastric fluid (SGF) or dilute HCl solutions (ca. 0.1 N). It is noteworthy that, although this is the pH of stomach under fasting conditions, it will not be the pH encountered in the surrounding of H. pylori-infested stomach tissue, which leads to higher pH figures than those found in healthy, empty stomachs. This is not a trivial issue because AMOX is a drug with two ionizable groups [AMOX pka (strongest basic): 7.22; AMOX pka (strongest acidic): 3.23, values obtained from , (accessed on 25 May 2022)] and, hence, its release profile will vary with gastric pH. Moreover, the co-administration of proton pump inhibitors or P-CAB in anti-H. pylori therapies raises the pH of gastric fluids to values ≥4.0. Consequently, it may happen that apparently successful formulations will not work in in vivo studies. Similarly, the behaviors of pH-responsive materials used in the development of such GRDDSs (such as NaAlg and G, for example) are expected to be different from those observed at pH 1.2.\\nThe other aspect to consider is the variety of drug cargo in each system, which will determine the final area under the curve (AUC) for AMOX and, therefore, the amount of drug available in the stomach to exert its antibacterial action. Despite the relevance of this information, it is not usually included explicitly in the papers. On another note, there are a few drawbacks generally associated with floating GRDDSs that must be overcome for the optimal final performance of these pharmaceutical formulations. Since the drug and the low-density system itself remain so intricately joined when the formulation is generated, one cannot be changed without the other, that is, release kinetics cannot be modified without irremediably varying the buoyancy of the system. Moreover, these kinds of formulation may tend to stick together when administered, potentially causing bowel obstruction, and they need high levels of fluid to work optimally.\\nTo sum up, the design of systems capable of loading large quantities of AMOX, performing at different pHs (1.2 and higher), and being stable and capable of disintegrating when the action is exerted is of fundamental importance. Insufficient research has been conducted in the pursuit of new floating materials capable of imparting mechanical stability and at the same time being swellable, porous, and degradable. There is no example in which the floatability of AMOX-loaded GRDDS is determined by its own microstructure. Additional properties, such as mucoadhesion and the capability to encapsulate large drug loads, will be of great significance. The development of such dosage forms is yet to be demonstrated.\\nThe other highly convenient type of GRDDS is mucoadhesive formulations. This is an excellent option when the pharmacological action required is local, since the mucoadhesive GRDDS can come into close contact with the infected area, remain adhered to the gastric mucosa for a prolonged period, and, consequently, achieve a sustained release of the drug where the pathogen is located.\\nMucus is a viscoelastic, gel-like, stringy slime which is mainly constituted of water (≤95% weight), inorganic salts (~1% weight), carbohydrates and lipids (<1%), and glycoproteins (<5% weight, also called mucins). The primary function of gastric mucus is to protect the gastric epithelium from acid and peptidases. In addition, it serves as a lubricant for the passage of solids and as a barrier to antigens, bacteria, and viruses. The epithelial adhesive properties of mucin are well known and have been applied to the development of GRDDSs through the use of bio/mucoadhesive polymers.\\nMucoadhesion can be defined as a characteristic feature of some natural or synthetic polymers that are able to attach to a mucosal surface. The process that evolves towards the mucoadhesive phenomenon can be described in three consecutive steps. (a) Wetting and swelling of the polymer is the initial step, which progresses to intimate contact with the mucosa. Hydrophilic polymers tend to absorb large amounts of water and become sticky, thus acquiring bioadhesive properties. (b) Once the hydrated polymer is in close contact with the mucosa, interpenetration and entanglement between the polymer and the mucin chains take place. These are physical-mechanical bonds that are related to the flexibility of the polymer chains and frequently occur in polysaccharide-based gums. (c) Lastly, this intricate intertwining of chains promotes the formation of secondary chemical bonds, i.e., electrostatic and hydrogen bonding, the latter being one of the most relevant in this type of interaction.\\nConsidering this mechanism, mucoadhesive properties can be enhanced, firstly, by the presence of hydrophilic functional groups that could promote the swelling process. Adhesion has been shown to be enhanced by rapid hydration, and there is linear relationship between swelling index and mucoadhesion, as demonstrated in some GRDDS formulations. Secondly, the flexibility of the polymer chains promotes the final mucoadhesive performance and, thirdly, the existence of ionic groups or/and proton donor or acceptor groups (such as hydroxyl, carboxyl, sulfate, and amino groups) is beneficial as they can participate in the formation of electrostatic or/and hydrogen bonds. Interestingly, polymers functionalized with sulfhydryl groups can render reversible disulfide linkages with mucin.\\nWhen eradication of H. pylori infection is aimed at, the preparation of mucoadhesive, gastroretentive dosage forms is especially advantageous, as they can adhere to the stomach wall, survive the gastrointestinal motility for a longer period, and thus enhance the local action of the drug in the infected area.\\nPolymers with high mucoadhesive strength are required for successful design of the mucoadhesive dosage form. Mucoadhesive polymers such as chitosan (CTS), pectin, Carbopol®, polyacrylic acid (PAA), and sodium carboxymethylcellulose (NaCMC) were reported as materials of interest in the preparation of mucoadhesive GRDDSs, as well as gums such as guar gum, gellan gum, and xanthan gum, and thiolated polymers, among others (Table 3).\\nThese polymers are characterized by their molecular flexibility and the presence of hydrophilic functional groups in their structure; they are non-toxic, non-absorbable, and inexpensive. Their interaction with mucin–epithelial surfaces is by means of non-covalent bonds, and they also readily adhere to moist surfaces. Another of their most significant features is that they can easily encapsulate a variety of drugs and not hinder the release of APIs, as will be demonstrated next.\\nHowever, the main inconvenience to overcome for optimal final performance of mucoadhesive pharmaceutical formulations is related to their proper adhesion to the stomach mucosa, which is directly correlated with their final performance. In this way, the constant turnover of this protective mucus layer could reduce the bioadhesion of the polymers. In this case, the use of microscale mucoadhesive particles, could be of help.\\nMicro- or nano-scaled mucoadhesive particles, such as liposome, polymeric, and metallic nanoparticles that may diffuse through the stomach mucosa and reach H. pylori have recently emerged as promising delivery mechanisms to improve bacterial eradication efficacy. In general terms, mucoadhesive microspheres ameliorated the gastric stability of AMOX due to entrapment within the microsphere.\\nMucoadhesive AMOX-loaded micro- and nanospheres are prepared with the concourse of one or various bioadhesive polymers (Table 4) by two main methods: ionic gelation and emulsion solvent evaporation. The first one (ionic gelation method) is based on the electrostatic interaction between a cationic polymer (CTS or its derivatives) with an anionic polysaccharide, typically NaAlg, PAA, sodium carboxymethylcellulose (NaCMC), pectin, or poly(malic acid). Since anionic polymers are polycarboxylic materials, Ca2+ ions from CaCl2 or CaSO4 can be added to improve the overall stability of the formulations. Similarly, sulfate anions from Na2SO4 or CaSO4 are employed to strengthen CTS-based GRDDSs. CTS is frequently employed as a coating agent. On the other hand, for the emulsion solvent evaporation method, a lipid phase is necessary (light liquid paraffin (LLP) or liquid paraffin (LP)), as well as a surfactant (for example, Span® 80 or Poloxamer® 188). Microsphere formation has also been made by spray-drying method using CTS as the only mucoadhesive polymer, which was chemically crosslinked with glutaraldehyde to impart the required stability to the formulation. The anionic polymer required for these formulations can be prepared de novo, as was the case with the co-polymerization of N-isopropylamide (NIPAM), acrylic acid (AA) and 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) for the design of a nanoparticulate formulation in which triethylene glycol dimethacrylate (TEGDMA) was chosen as the chemical crosslinker.\\nAnother approach is the preparation of nanostructured formulations such as polymeric nanoparticles and liposomes containing AMOX. The design of mucoadhesive liposomes has been conducted with success by the preparation of pectin-coated liposomes. This formulation is characterized by its ability to diminish the first step in the development of H. pylori pathogenicity, i.e., its adhesion to the gastric epithelium. To note, recent studies are focused on nano- and micro-composites for the release of AMOX in which insoluble materials such as magnesium aluminum silicate (MAS,), carbon quantum dots (CDs,) and superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIO,) are incorporated with the aim of imparting additional properties to the final formulations. Although micro- or nano-scale mucoadhesive particles may diffuse through the stomach mucosa and reach H. pylori, they are characterized by low drug-loading capacity.\\nMucoadhesive performance is commonly measured on model mucosae (goat intestinal mucosa, pig’s ileum, or rat stomach mucosa) or on freshly prepared simulated gastric mucosa. In another study, Wistar rats were employed to study in vivo gastric mucoadhesion. The percentage of AMOX-loaded microparticles that remain adhered to the tissue is evaluated, either for a pre-established time or after washing them out with simulated gastric or intestinal fluids (SGF or SIF, respectively). Other methods involve the use of commercial mucins, and bioadhesive properties are determined by microviscometry or based on changes in parameters such as surface charge potentials and aggregation rate (Table 4).\\nA linear relationship was observed between the swelling index of microspheres and their mucoadhesion, apart from the impact that the former exerted on drug release, as will be discussed below. Therefore, determination of swelling properties is crucial: massive increases in weight have been found for some formulations such as co-p(NIPAM-AA-HEMA) nanoparticles (NPs, swelling index: 900–1300%), composite blend microbeads of NaAlg, NaCMC and MAS particles (swelling index: 280–730%), minimatrices of xanthan gum (XG), HPMC and PEO (swelling index: 150–500%), and microspheres made of NaAlg, guar gum (GG), and Carbopol® (swelling index: 55–260%), to name a few examples. The degree of crosslinking of the prepared microspheres is directly connected with their mucoadhesive properties, so the higher the degree of crosslinking of the materials, the lower their swelling parameters, and hence, a consequent reduction in mucoadhesive properties will be found.\\nSwelling properties were also investigated to assess their influence on solvent uptake and, thus, release patterns, and a direct relationship with drug diffusion was observed. For instance, it has been reported that the inclusion of guar gum in the composition of AMOX-loaded formulations facilitated the transfer of solvent to the microspheres. The observed sustained drug release was attribute to guar gum hydration and swelling. A similar behavioral pattern was found in chitosan microspheres, and a linear correlation between swelling index and the in vitro AMOX release was established. The degree of swelling was likewise negatively linked to the degree of crosslinking. Furthermore, in MAS-based composite blend microbeads, the higher the swelling, the higher the experimental release rate. The release of the drug was also affected by the polymer concentration (negative outcome) and the presence of a lipophilic excipient (for example, sunflower oil), which formed a strong hydrophobic diffusional barrier and retarded the drug release from the beads significantly.\\nIn contrast to release studies conducted with floating GRDDSs, the release behavior of AMOX was investigated for some mucoadhesive systems not only at pH 1.2, but also at pH 5.0 or pH ca. 7.0 (simulating gastric acid, gastric mucosa, or optimal H. pylori survival conditions, respectively). Sequential pH changes throughout the experiment were also addressed for magnetic and CDs-based nanocomposites. In general terms, in vitro AMOX release rates were higher at pH ≈ 1 than those found at pH ≈ 7.\\nHowever, as with floating GRDDSs, there are some inconveniences to overcome for optimal final performance of mucoadhesive pharmaceutical formulations. The main aspect to deal with is related to their proper adhesion to the stomach mucosa, which is directly correlated with their final performance. In this way, the constant turnover of this protective mucus layer could reduce the bioadhesion of the polymers.\\nConsequently, although the development of simple-working GRDDSs has partially helped to overcome the drawbacks associated with conventional dosage forms, further work is needed on its shortcomings. The development of dual-working polymeric materials (such as floating and mucoadhesive systems) in the treatment of H. pylori infections is an interesting approach to substantially lengthen the gastric residence time of AMOX (Table 5 includes some examples of such systems). Giving buoyant properties to mucoadhesive multiparticulate dosage forms may guarantee consistent release of the drug in the target site. The portion of beads that remains floating will be available to ensure the replenishment of the units detached due to the turnover of the mucus layer.\\nIn summary, an in-depth study on H. pylori infections, as well as the current status and the difficulties encountered in its eradication, have been the central topics of the present work. Many attempts have been made to prepare GRDDSs with suitable properties for application as anti-H. pylori treatments, which is especially relevant due to the relationship established between this pathogen and gastric cancer. Amoxicillin has proven to be the most effective antibiotic and the one showing the least amount of resistant H. pylori strains within the therapeutic arsenal against this bacterium. Numerous buoyant and mucoadhesive GRDDSs, as well as dual-working systems, have been designed and formulated. This review analyzes the most relevant works related to them, highlighting the main strategies followed and the advantages and drawbacks associated with them. The procedures described herein could shed some light on the development of novel and better-tuned materials against the colonization of this microorganism. We anticipate that the present work could inspire the development of cutting-edge GRDDSs with clear and improved benefits in H. pylori treatments that may extend to improving therapeutic approaches for other endemic diseases.\\nConceptualization, validation, formal analysis, project administration, supervision, funding acquisition: M.-V.d.-P.

       "    'fulltext': 'Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) of gastric neoplasms is a minimally invasive and well-established procedure. However, post-ESD bleeding from artificial ulcers remains an unsolved problem. Vonoprazan (Takeda Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) directly inhibits proton pumps without requiring activation by gastric acid. In addition, it rapidly and strongly suppresses acid secretion. Vonoprazan has a dissociation coefficient of 9.37 and is more likely to accumulate in the secretory tubules of the stomach than proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). In addition, vonoprazan offers several advantages over PPIs that allow it to achieve a higher gastric pH. These include rapid drug absorption after administration (median Tmax, 2 h), longer plasma half-life than PPIs, and no interindividual pharmacokinetic variations due to differences in cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) genotypes. A crossover study demonstrated that vonoprazan could suppress gastric acid secretion rapidly and more strongly than PPIs. Therefore, vonoprazan is expected to be more effective than PPIs for treating artificial gastric ulcers resulting from ESD. Our previous observational study showed that vonoprazan suppressed post-ESD bleeding more effectively than PPIs. However, subsequent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing PPIs and vonoprazan in terms of post-ESD bleeding control did not find vonoprazan to be superior to PPIs.\\nWith an increase in the aging population, the number of patients being administered antithrombotic drugs is increasing in developed countries. The proportion of patients undergoing gastric ESD who receive antithrombotic drugs is also expected to increase. A meta-analysis revealed that antithrombotic drug users have a significantly increased risk of post-ESD bleeding than non-users, regardless of whether they suspended the treatment perioperatively. However, the analysis only included studies in which PPIs were used to treat post-ESD ulcers. To improve the safety of gastric ESD, it is important to determine whether vonoprazan suppresses post-ESD bleeding more effectively than PPIs in individuals consuming antithrombotic drugs.\\nA subgroup analysis in our observational study suggested that vonoprazan suppresses post-ESD bleeding in antithrombotic drug users. Safety-critical RCTs generally exclude patients at high risk of trial-related complications. Indeed, RCTs with post-ESD bleeding as the primary endpoint excluded antithrombotic drug users. In RCTs that included antithrombotic drug users, it was difficult to draw firm conclusions regarding the prevention of post-ESD bleeding for several reasons. These reasons include the primary endpoint being ulcer reduction, small sample size, inclusion sample size of antithrombotic drug users, low post-bleeding rates, and slow initiation of vonoprazan.\\nIn real-world clinical practice, complications associated with ESD have major consequences in elderly individuals and patients with serious comorbidities who cannot be included in RCTs. Cross-design synthesis (CDS) is a method for estimating the treatment effect in patients excluded from RCTs. It involves pooling the data of an observational study and an RCT to estimate the treatment effect in the overall treated population. In the present study, we used CDS to evaluate the inhibitory effect of vonoprazan on post-ESD gastric ulcer bleeding in patients consuming antithrombotic drugs.\\nIn this study, we used CDS, a method that pools the results of an observational study and an RCT, to estimate treatment effects in patients excluded from the RCT and the overall treated population. Specifically, the observational study included subgroups that met the exclusion criteria of the RCT. The CDS method, designed to address the generalizability problem in a real-world clinical setting caused by sample selection bias in RCTs, is used to estimate the effect of a treatment on a patient population that is unable to participate in RCTs using observational data. As the patients in the observational study were not randomized, the results could be biased due to treatment selection errors. However, the CDS estimator is unbiased if the assumption that the treatment selection error for stratified estimators from the observational study is constant across strata. The details of the assumptions that the CDS estimator is unbiased are shown in the S1 and S2 Appendices. This study evaluated the effectiveness of vonoprazan in patients taking antithrombotic drugs, focusing on the exclusion criteria for antithrombotic drug use. Antithrombotic drugs were defined as taking either antiplatelet or anticoagulant drugs, and data based on the study by Kagawa et al. that included patients taking antithrombotic drugs were used for the observational study. A summary of the pooled studies is presented in Table 1. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Graduate School and Faculty of Medicine, Kyoto University (approval number: R2141) and the Ethics Committee of Kagawa Prefectural Central Hospital (approval number: 839), and adhered to the Declaration of Helsinki and Ethical Guidelines for Medical and Health Research Involving Human Subjects.\\nTo identify studies eligible for analysis, a literature search was conducted using the PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane library databases for all articles published through November 2020. The initial search terms included ‘vonoprazan’, ‘Takecab’, ‘TAK-438’, ‘potassium-competitive inhibitor’, ‘ESD’, and ‘endoscopic submucosal dissection’. An example of a full electronic search strategy used for the online database is shown in S1 Table and a flow diagram for assessing the studies is shown in Fig 1.\\nA total of 101 articles were identified by literature search, and after letters, meta-analyses, and duplicate articles and protocols were excluded, six RCTs were eligible for CSD pooling. All six RCTs compared the efficacy of vonoprazan with PPIs for post-ESD bleeding. Vonoprazan was administered 1 day before ESD in three studies, and a few days after ESD in the other three. The former group of RCTs was considered eligible for CDS because these studies used the same vonoprazan dosing regimen as the study by Kagawa et al. (i.e., vonoprazan administration the day before ESD). We decided to use the RCT by Hamada et al., which set the primary endpoint as bleeding after ESD and calculated the planned sample size.\\nThe study by Hamada et al. was an open-label, prospective, randomized phase II clinical trial conducted at the Osaka International Cancer Center in Japan. One hundred and forty patients who underwent ESD between 2015 and 2016 were enrolled, and patients taking antithrombotic drugs were excluded. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to vonoprazan (n = 69) or PPI (n = 70).\\nFor the observational study data, we used the data of ESD cases performed at our hospital from 2005 to 2018. The study by Kagawa et. al. used data up to 2015, but the sample size of 17 patients taking antithrombotic drugs was small and considered insufficient to examine the effect in patients taking antithrombotic drugs. Therefore, in this study, we used data up to 2018, when the sample size of antithrombotic and non-antithrombotic patients was more than 70 cases per group, similar to the sample size design of Hamada et al.\\nThe observational study data analyzed in the CDS included patients taking antithrombotic drugs. In this study, 408 patients who underwent ESD and were treated with vonoprazan for postoperative ulcer treatment at Kagawa Prefectural Central Hospital in Japan from April 2014, when vonoprazan was launched in April 2018 were prospectively enrolled in the vonoprazan group. Then, from among 870 patients who underwent ESD and were treated with PPIs from 2005 to 2014, before the launch of vonoprazan, were analyzed as historical controls. All participants provided written informed consent, and they were given the opportunity to opt out of the present study.\\nWhen performing CDS, the outcomes and study protocols of the studies to be pooled should be largely consistent. The treatment schedules in the RCT and observational studies are shown in Fig 2. The withdrawal schedules for each antithrombotic drug in the observational study are shown in Fig 3.\\nParticipants in both studies were admitted the day before ESD, and all participants were hospitalized for 7 days. In both studies, the vonoprazan group started oral vonoprazan 20 mg on the day before ESD. The PPI group in the RCT started oral lansoprazole 30 mg the day before ESD, but those in the observational study received omeprazole intravenously for 2 days (day 0 and day 1, 40 mg/day) and then started oral rabeprazole (from day 2, 20 mg/day). An infusion of omeprazole is known to rapidly raise the pH in the stomach to above 4.2 within a few hours. On the other hand, oral PPIs require several days of dosing to show effects because they must be activated by acid. Therefore, the PPI groups in the two studies can be regarded as roughly equivalent regarding the PPI doses intended to produce an effect on the day of ESD.\\nVonoprazan was administered for 8 weeks in the RCT and 5 weeks in the observational study. Most post-ESD bleeding events develop within the first two weeks after ESD. In the study by Hamada et al., the Kaplan-Meier method was used to determine the cumulative non-bleeding rate within 28 days after ESD, and all bleeding occurred within 14 days after ESD. Data from the observational study were used to analyze the outcomes up to 28 days after ESD. Thus, the durations of drug administration and outcome observations in the two studies were the same.\\nThe primary outcome of this study was post-ESD bleeding, which was defined as hematemesis, melena, or a decrease in hemoglobin of ≤ 2 g/dl in both the RCT and observational studies.\\nThe CDS in this study used the estimate of the treatment effect in patients not taking antithrombotic drugs, derived from the RCT, and the estimate of the treatment effect stratified by use of antithrombotic drugs, derived from the observational study. For the estimate from the RCT, we used the risk difference shown in Hamada et al..\\nPropensity score matching (PSM) was performed to avoid the effects of measurable confounding factors when using observational study data. One-to-one matching without replacement was completed using the nearest neighbor match on the logit of the propensity score for the treatment approach with a caliper width set to 0.2 times the standard deviation of the logit of the propensity score. To estimate the propensity score, we fitted a logistic regression model for treatment as a function of patient characteristics, specifically age, Helicobacter pylori infection, tumor size, and tumor location. PSM was performed in the overall treated patients, patients taking antithrombotic drugs, and patients not taking antithrombotic drugs, and the risk difference in the matched data was calculated for each patient population.\\nSummary statistics were constructed using frequencies and proportions for categorical data and means and standard deviations for continuous data. Standardized differences were estimated for the factors used in the propensity score model after matching to assess post-match balance. Standardized differences of less than 10.0% for a given covariate indicate a relatively small imbalance. The Wald confidence interval (CI) was used to indicate risk differences in the observational study. Confidence intervals for the CDS-based estimates were calculated using the method presented by Kaizer. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS software (version 9.4; SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) and R version 3.6.3 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).\\nWe analyzed the RCT data from Hamada et al. comprising 70 patients in the vonoprazan group and 69 in the PPI group along with the observational study data of 408 patients in the vonoprazan group and 870 in the PPI group. The patient characteristics from each study are shown in Table 2. With the use of PSM in the overall treated patients, 392 patients in the vonoprazan group were matched with 392 patients in the PPI group. Similarly, among the patients who were administered antithrombotic drugs, 86 patients in the vonoprazan group were matched with 86 patients in the PPI group. In addition, among patients not consuming antithrombotic drugs, 306 patients in the vonoprazan group were matched with 306 patients in the PPI group. Out of the total number of treated patients, 16 patients (nine patients taking antithrombotic medications and seven patients not taking antithrombotic medications) were dropped because of caliper matching. Among those that were matched, the standardized differences were below 10.0% for all factors, indicating only small differences between the two groups (Table 3).\\nThe efficacy of vonoprazan compared with that of PPIs in preventing post-ESD bleeding is summarized in Table 4. Based on observational study data, the bleeding rate was 5.4% in the vonoprazan group and 5.6% in the PPI group. The estimated treatment effect among all the treated patients (the risk difference), including those taking and not taking antithrombotic drugs, was -0.3% (95% CI: -3.4% to −2.9%). In contrast, the estimate obtained by pooling data from the RCT and the observational study using CDS was -4.3% (95% CI: -11.7% to 3.1%). The bleeding rate in patients not taking antithrombotic medication was 4.3% in the RCT and 3.9% in the observational study for the vonoprazan group, 5.7% in the RCT, and 2.3% in the observational study for the PPI group. The estimated treatment effect was -1.4% (95% CI: -10.3% to 7.3%) in the RCT and 1.6% (95% CI: -1.1% to 4.4%) in the observational study. The bleeding rates among patients taking antithrombotics were 9.3% and 20.9% in the vonoprazan and PPI groups, respectively. The estimated treatment effect was -11.6% (95% CI: -22.2% to -1.1%) based on the observational study; however, the estimate obtained using CDS was -14.6% (95% CI: -22.0% to -7.2%).\\nThe results of post-ESD bleeding according to the type of antithrombotic drug used are shown in Table 5. Of the 86 patients in the vonoprazan group, 45 were on antiplatelet monotherapy, such as low-dose aspirin (LA)—32 were on LA, 11 on thienopridine, and 2 on other antiplatelet agents. Twenty-six patients received dual antiplatelet therapy (four received LA and thienopridine, seven received LA and other antiplatelet agents, and 15 received two other antiplatelet agents), of which two patients suffered post-ESD bleeding. Eight patients were on anticoagulant monotherapy (warfarin) and three were on direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) (two on rivaroxaban and one on dabigatran), of which three and zero patients, respectively, experienced post-ESD bleeding. Three patients were on both, an antiplatelet agent and an anticoagulant (warfarin) (one on LA and warfarin, two on other antiplatelet agents and warfarin) and two patients were on both, an antiplatelet agent and an anticoagulant (DOAC) (one on other antiplatelet agents and apixaban, one on LA and dabigatran), of which zero and one patient, respectively, showed post-ESD bleeding. Of the 86 patients in the PPI group, 37 were on antiplatelet monotherapy (23 on LA, 10 on thienopridine, 4 on other antiplatelet agents) and 24 patients were on dual antiplatelet therapy (4 on LA and thienopridine, 7 on LA and other antiplatelet agents, 12 on two other antiplatelet agents), of which 3 and 7 patients, respectively, experienced post-ESD bleeding. Seventeen patients were on anticoagulant monotherapy (warfarin), of which three patients suffered post-ESD bleeding. Seven patients were on both, an antiplatelet agent and an anticoagulant (warfarin) (four on LA and warfarin, three on other antiplatelet agents and warfarin) and one patient was on both, an antiplatelet agent and an anticoagulant (DOAC) (LA and rivaroxaban), of which four and one patient, respectively, experienced post-ESD bleeding.\\nAn observational study by Kagawa et al. suggested that vonoprazan significantly reduced post-ESD bleeding compared to PPIs. However, these results were inconsistent with the results of the RCT conducted by Hamada et al., which led us to perform the present study.\\nIn their observational study, Kagawa et al. revealed that the risk difference of post-ESD bleeding in patients consuming antithrombotic drugs between vonoprazan and PPIs was -36.7%; however, the sample size for patients taking antithrombotic drugs was insufficient. In addition, the robustness of evidence from observational studies is limited. Therefore, in the present study, we increased the sample size of patients receiving antithrombotic drugs and examined the results using the CDS method. This guided treatment selection bias in the observational study data. Subsequently, the risk difference in patients taking antithrombotics was -11.6%, while that using the CDS method was -14.6%. Regarding tumor size, the patients enrolled in the observational study had a larger tumor size than those enrolled in the RCT. Therefore, the estimates of treatment effects from observational study data may be biased due to higher bleeding rates. However, since the percentage of patients with large tumors was similar between patients with and without antithrombotic medication in the observational study, the CDS estimator may have excluded such bias, by the definition of sufficient conditions under which the CDS estimator is unbiased.\\nThe two main types of anticoagulants are warfarin and DOACs. In two studies consisting of a small number of DOAC users, the frequency of post-ESD bleeding events was reported to be 20.8% and 22.0%, respectively. The risk of post-ESD bleeding was reportedly higher with warfarin than with DOACs in high-risk endoscopic procedures. However, there was no difference in the risk of bleeding during upper gastrointestinal ESD. In addition, the risk of post-ESD bleeding differs between individual DOAC users. Since only six DOAC users were included in this study, further studies are needed to determine the risk of post-ESD bleeding with specific anticoagulant drugs.\\nIn this study, most of the enrolled antithrombotic drug users were receiving a single antiplatelet agent. A previous meta-analysis revealed that single antiplatelet agent use was also a risk factor for post-ESD bleeding, with an odds ratio of 2.08 compared to non-users. Other studies have shown that the odds ratios for post-ESD bleeding in patients who received double antiplatelet therapy, warfarin, or LDA and warfarin were 5.06, 10.15, and 14.38, respectively, when compared with non-antithrombotic drug users. In this study, following PSM, we assessed the difference in the incidence of post-ESD bleeding between vonoprazan and PPIs according to the type of antithrombotic drug used. The post-ESD bleeding rate with the combined use of an antiplatelet and anticoagulant (warfarin or DOAC), which are presumed to pose the highest risk of bleeding, was lower in the vonoprazan group than in the PPI group (20.0% vs. 62.5%). The superiority of vonoprazan over PPI in preventing post-ESD bleeding may, therefore, be more pronounced in patients at a high risk of bleeding.\\nSeveral attempts have been made to prevent post-ESD bleeding. Long-term discontinuation of antithrombotic drugs before and after gastric ESD may help avoid increasing the risk of post-gastric ESD bleeding caused by antithrombotic drugs. Several retrospective studies have reported that discontinuing antithrombotic therapy a week before gastric ESD does not increase the risk of thromboembolism. However, other studies have shown that prolonged discontinuation can increase the risk of thromboembolism. Traditionally, bridging therapy from oral warfarin to intravenous heparin has been used during the perioperative period of ESD, considering both thromboembolism and post-ESD bleeding. Unfortunately, bridging therapy in anticoagulant users is not appropriate for gastric ESD because it does not decrease every complication. Second-look endoscopy (SLE) has been performed after ESD to evaluate the ulcer condition and to perform preventive hemostatic treatment for high-risk bleeding ulcers. However, SLE cannot suppress bleeding after ESD, and bleeding prevention procedures performed during SLE may be harmful. Therefore, other methods are necessary to suppress post-ESD bleeding in antithrombotic drug users.\\nIn upper gastrointestinal bleeding, the intragastric pH significantly affects the coagulation system (including platelets), which is involved in hemostasis. An intragastric pH of 5.4 or higher is required for blood coagulation to achieve hemostasis in peptic ulcers because pepsin causes platelet destruction at pH 5.0–5.5. This suggests that maintaining an intragastric pH of at least 5.4 is extremely important for suppressing post-ESD bleeding. Treatment for ESD-induced artificial ulcers with gastric acid inhibitors is usually initiated on the date of ESD. However, post-ESD bleeding occurs most frequently within 24 hours after the procedure. In the observational study analyzed here, vonoprazan was administered 1 day before ESD to achieve a high intragastric pH on the day of performing the technique, thereby facilitating effective hemostatic function. The RCT analyzed in the present study also involved the administration of vonoprazan in the same way.\\nConcerning gastric acid suppression, PPI administration can also achieve an intragastric pH of 5 or more, even when administered intravenously or orally. In the observational study, a combination of 2-day intravenous infusions of omeprazole and an oral intake of 20 mg of rabeprazole was adopted in the PPI group. A single infusion of omeprazole is known to quickly increase the intragastric pH >4.25. On the other hand, for the PPI group in the RCT, administration of oral lansoprazole 30 mg was started the day before ESD was conducted. The ratios of post-ESD bleeding in non-antithrombotic drug users were low and almost the same in the observational study and RCT (2.3% vs. 5.7%, respectively), suggesting that a sufficiently high intragastric pH was achieved by PPI administration on the day of ESD, to provide adequate prophylaxis against bleeding in non-high-risk patients.\\nA crossover study compared vonoprazan with a PPI in terms of inhibiting gastric acid secretion. The holding time ratios at an intragastric pH of 5 or higher on day 1 after administration of vonoprazan and esomeprazole were 62.8% and 13.0%, respectively, and those for vonoprazan and rabeprazole were 76.6% and 16.7%, respectively. However, esomeprazole and rabeprazole were better able to achieve an intragastric pH of 5 or higher after 7 days of administration (48.3% and 53.2%, respectively). Although initiating PPI therapy 7 days before ESD is difficult in everyday clinical practice, it might further reduce the risk of bleeding in antithrombotic drug users.\\nBecause of various types of biases, patients with medical backgrounds that might affect the results were excluded from the study. However, it has been reported that the results of RCTs obtained in this way differ from those observed in real-world clinical practice. The CDS method was designed by the United States General Accounting Office to address the generalizability problem caused by sample selection bias in RCTs. Recently, the statistical properties of the CDS estimator have been evaluated by Kaizer. In the simulation studies, the CDS estimates had a lower bias than the commonly used estimates based on randomized or observational studies alone under reasonable data assumptions. Therefore, very few studies have employed CDS to analyze real-world clinical data. In this study, CDS analysis suggested that vonoprazan is more effective than PPIs in preventing post-ESD bleeding in patients taking antithrombotic drugs. It may be difficult to perform RCTs targeting antithrombotic drug users with various comorbidities. However, we believe that future observational studies will confirm the validity of the results obtained in this study.\\nThis study had several limitations. First, even if the confounding effects could have been examined by CDS, selection bias cannot be ruled out because both RCT and observational studies were from a single center. CDS estimates may depend on the data used; therefore, it is necessary to examine a variety of data. In addition, when integrating data from two studies, all items were not the same in the design of the observational studies and RCTs. Second, the CDS method cannot account for all unknown confounders, and the validity of sufficient conditions cannot be confirmed from the data. Therefore, the bias of the estimates using CDS is not always zero, and further improvement of the method is desired. Third, although the same experienced endoscopists performed ESD in the PPI and vonoprazan groups in the observational study, the results may have been influenced by the endoscopists’ experience. Finally, neither of the two studies analyzed here investigated the relationship between gastric pH and post-ESD bleeding.\\n10.1371/journal.pone.0261703.r001\\nMahadeva\\nSanjiv\\nThis is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.\\n 1 Oct 2021 \\nPONE-D-21-19373Efficacy of vonoprazan against bleeding from endoscopic submucosal dissection-induced gastric ulcers under antithrombotic medication: A cross-design synthesis of randomized and observational studiesPLOS ONE\\nDear Dr. Hidaka,\\nThank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE.

The authors used the uncommon but interesting statistic method in data analysis to evaluate the efficacy of vonoprazan in preventing post ESD bleeding in patients taking anti-platelet and/or anti-coagulant, compared to PPI. However, there are many important major concerns that need to clarify in the manuscript as the followings;\\nMajor concerns\\n1. From table 5, the percentage of combination of anti-platelet and anti-coagulant (warfarin) was obviously higher in PPI group (0% vs. 57%). This maybe the factor contributing higher rebleeding rate in PPI group. Please discuss on this issue.\\n2. In discussion part, the author stated that “In patients taking antithrombotic drugs, vonoprazan was expected to reduce post-ESD bleeding to a greater extent than PPIs, and the observational study by Kagawa et al. [7] suggested that vonoprazan reduced post-ESD bleeding in patients taking antithrombotic drugs. However, these results were inconsistent with those of the subsequent RCT by Hamada et al. [8], which led us to perform the present study.” In fact, the study by Hamada excluded the patients taking antithrombotic drugs, thus the results were different from previous observational study as they assessed the patients in different group. Please consider re-write.\\n3. The authors said that “An intragastric pH of 5.4 or higher is required for blood coagulation to achieve haemostasis in peptic ulcer” and showed that Vonoprazan provided the targeted pH. However, this was not only the ability of Vonoprazan but also PPIs. Please revised those sentences, otherwise the reader maybe confused.\\n4. Please put the reference to this sentence “It remains unanswered whether the results obtained in RCTs are inconsistent with the facts observed in real-world clinical practice, which involves treating patients from diverse backgrounds.” In theory, this sentence may not true as the real-world data contains various type of bias and that is the reason for conducting RCT.\\n5. The discussion part was too long and some sentences eg. “Keith and Constance reported that clinical studies evaluating the effects of alcohol treatment excluded patients with more severe alcohol disorders and those with low incomes and psychiatric problems”, etc. were not relevant to the present study. Please consider shortening the discussion part.\\nReviewer #2:\\xa0Hidaka et al. conducted a cross-design synthesis evaluating the treatment effects between Vonoprazan and Proton-pump inhibitor in anti-thrombotic users who underwent gastric ESD. They concluded that from the pooled data of selected from one RCT and one observational data from their center as a historical control, Vonoprazan is more effective than PPI in preventing post-ESD bleeding among patients using anti-thrombotics. The study is clinically relevant with an interesting concept. However, a few shortcomings exist.\\n1. The definition of “taking anti-thrombotic medication” lacks the timing and duration in relation to the procedure i.e. were the medications taken throughout periprocedural period or were they stopped at any point prior to the procedure.\\n2. Among 3 RCTs included, the other two studies had sample size calculated too. Please specify more elaborative reasons why the study by Hamada et al. was chosen over the other two.\\n3. Since Vonoprazan requires shorter onset of action and shorter duration to reach its steady level, administering oral PPI one day prior to the ESD procedures may not be adequate time for bleeding prophylaxis. This limitation should be discussed.\\n4. As ESD with PPI prophylaxis performed before Vonoprazan became available were used as historical control, the bleeding outcome is inevitably confounded by endoscopists\\' experience which would be less than ESDs performed later (Vonoprazan group). Please discuss this limitation.\\n5. Statistically significant difference between each type of antithrombotic medications in each group (PPI vs Vonoprazan) should be presented in Table 5.\\n6. The authors rightfully stated that the risk of post-ESD bleeding differed between individual DOACs and other antithrombotic medication therefore, the differences between each antithrombotic regimen in both Vonoprazan and PPI group in this study needs to be further elaborated.\\n7. There is a few numerical errors e.g. Specific anti-thrombotic stratification is presented in Table 5, not 4\\n8. The difference in pharmacokinetic of vonoprazan and PPI should be moved to introduction\\n9. There are a few grammatical and spelling errors. Please proofread the manuscript again.\\n**********\\n6.

       "    'fulltext': 'Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are commonly prescribed as the first-line drug for the treatment of acid-related diseases such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) by inhibiting H+/K + -ATPase. However, some limitations prevent PPIs from becoming the ideal antisecretory drugs. The major limitations are as follows: 1) PPIs are acid labile, 2) PPIs shows a slow onset of action, taking 3–5\\xa0days for the appropriate effect, 3) PPIs show interindividual variations in pharmacokinetics (PK) according to cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19, and 4) PPIs fail to suppress nocturnal acid secretion expected by the short half-life.\\nPotassium-competitive acid blocker (P-CAB) is a new class of drugs that inhibits gastric H+/K + -ATPase. While PPIs require chemical conversion to their active form and only inhibit an activated form of H+/K + -ATPase, P-CAB does not require acid activation and reversely inhibits both an activated and inactivated form of H+/K + -ATPase by competitively blocking the potassium-binding site. Therefore, P-CAB shows a rapid onset of acid suppression and continuous acid suppression until the night compared to PPIs.\\nVonoprazan, a P-CAB developed by Takeda Pharmaceutical Company, received approvals for acid-related diseases in some countries, including Japan and Korea. Tegoprazan, a P-CAB developed by HK inno.N, was recently approved to treat acid-related diseases such as GERD. Vonoprazan and tegoprazan are mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 and partially by CYP2B6, 2C19, 2D6.\\nA recent study suggested the potential that vonoprazan acts as a moderate inhibitor of CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. The results of in vitro studies indicated that vonoprazan could inhibit the metabolism of midazolam, the substrate of CYP3A4, and venlafaxine, the substrate of CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. In addition, the in vivo studies supported the results of the in vitro studies, which implicated the drug-drug interactions between vonoprazan and the substrates of CYP3A4. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) value of CYP3A4 for vonoprazan was 29\\xa0μM, and this value is thought to be much higher than the plasma concentration of vonoprazan at clinical doses. However, the potential CYP3A4 inhibitory effect of vonoprazan on drugs having first-pass effect is unknown. Although tegoprazan showed various inhibitory activities to organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATP) 1B1 according to the in vitro study, the systemic exposure of the substrates would not significantly increase considering the maximum concentration of tegoprazan at clinical doses.\\nOne of the substrates of CYP3A4 and OATP1B is 3‐hydroxy‐3‐methylglutaryl co‐enzyme A (HMG‐CoA) reductase inhibitors, including atorvastatin. The bioavailability of atorvastatin is approximately 14%, and this low bioavailability is attributed to first-pass metabolism in the intestinal mucosa and the liver, in which CYP3A4 is involved. When absorbed through the intestine, 76% of orally administered atorvastatin is lost in the gut, and 42% of the remaining amount is lost in the liver. Therefore, when atorvastatin was co-administered with a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor such as itraconazole, the systemic exposure of atorvastatin increased, and the systemic exposure of 2-hydroxyatorvastatin, a metabolite of atorvastatin, decreased.\\nThe number of PPI users increased 10.6 times over 12\\xa0years, and the prescription rate of atorvastatin generally increased over 13\\xa0years. PPIs and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are frequently co-administered with clopidogrel in Korea. The frequency of co-administering PPIs and atorvastatin would increase over time, and thus it is necessary to evaluate the drug interactions between P-CABs and atorvastatin. This study aimed to evaluate the PK of atorvastatin and safety profile when co-administered with P-CABs, vonoprazan or tegoprazan.\\nThis was an open-label, multiple-dose, 3-intervention, 4-sequence, 4-period, partial replicate crossover study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04221321). The study protocol was approved by the institutional review board at Samsung Medical Center (Seoul, Republic of Korea) and the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety. All subjects gave written informed consent.\\nThere were three interventions in this study, and daily administration for 7\\xa0days of atorvastatin 40\\xa0mg (LIPITOR®, Pfizer Inc., NY, United States) alone was defined as intervention R. Moreover, atorvastatin 40\\xa0mg co-administered with tegoprazan 50\\xa0mg (K-CAB®, HK inno.N Corporation, Republic of Korea) and atorvastatin 40\\xa0mg co-administered with vonoprazan 20\\xa0mg (TAKECAB®, Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, Japan) was named as intervention T and intervention V, respectively. Among three interventions, subjects received intervention R twice and received intervention T and V once each. Subjects were allocated to one of the four sequences: T-R-V-R, R-T-R-V, R-V-R-T, and V-R-T-R (Figure 1). There were washout periods of 7–9\\xa0days between each intervention. Furthermore, this study was carried out in three groups since entire subjects could not be studied simultaneously. Assuming the within-subject coefficient of variation (CV) of atorvastatin as 40 and 15% as dropout rate, the planned sample size was 36 subjects providing more than 80% statistical power with a significance level of 0.05 to demonstrate 33% difference of PK parameter by drug interactions.\\nThis study enrolled healthy male subjects aged 19–55\\xa0years with a body mass index of 19–27\\xa0kg/m2. Major exclusion criteria were: a history of genetic myopathy or family history; a history of taking any medications or foods that could significantly affect the PK of atorvastatin within 30\\xa0days before the randomization; blood aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase or gamma-glutamyltransferase levels exceeding 1.5 times the upper limit of the reference range; an estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 60\\xa0ml/min/1.73\\xa0m2.\\nSubjects had scheduled visits on the morning of Days 1–4 for dosing and then were admitted to the Clinical Trial Center of Samsung Medical Center on the evening of Day 4. Subjects received the study drug orally with water of 150\\xa0ml after an overnight fast of at least 10\\xa0h on Days 5–7 and were required to fast for an additional 4\\xa0h postdose on Day 7.\\nSerial blood samples were collected for PK assessment before dosing and at 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.25, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 24\\xa0h after the last repeated dose (Day 7). Blood samples were centrifuged at approximately 1,800\\xa0g for 10\\xa0min at 4°C, and then the plasma samples were stored at less than -70°C until the assays.\\nSafety was assessed based on symptom reports, physical examinations, vital signs, 12-lead ECGs, and clinical laboratory tests (hematology, clinical chemistry, and urinalysis).\\nPlasma samples for atorvastatin, 2-hydroxyatorvastatin and atorvastatin lactone were analyzed with ultra‐performance liquid chromatography (Waters ACQUITY UPLCTM System; Waters, Milford, MA) - tandem quadruple spectrometry (Waters XevoTM TQ-XS MS; Waters, Milford, MA) method. Atorvastatin-d5, 2-hydroxyatorvastatin-d5 and atorvastatin lactone-d5 were used as the internal standard. The range for quantification was 0.100–200\\xa0ng/ml for atorvastatin, 0.0500–100\\xa0ng/ml for 2-hydroxyatorvastatin and atorvastatin lactone. The correction coefficients (r2) were greater than 0.99 over these concentration ranges. The precision and accuracy for mean within-run data and mean between-run data of all analytes were determined using the percentage of relative SD (%RSD) and the percentage of deviation of the mean from theoretical (%DMT).\\nThe precision and accuracy for mean within-run data on atorvastatin in quality control (QC) samples (concentration range, 0.100–150\\xa0ng/ml) ranged from 0.6 to 2.7 and -1.6 to 1.5, respectively. The precision and accuracy for mean between-run data on atorvastatin in QC samples were determined from 1.1 to 2.5 and from −2.9 to −0.3, respectively. Based on back-calculated concentration, the between-run precision and accuracy ranged from 0.3 to 1.6 and from −1.8 to 2.1, respectively.\\nThe within-run precision and accuracy for two metabolites in QC samples (concentration range, 0.0500–75.0\\xa0ng/ml) ranged from 0.4 to 4.6 and −3.0 to 0.7 on 2-hydroxyatorvastatin, respectively, and from 1.5 to 2.3 and 1.4 to 7.3 on atorvastatin lactone, respectively. The between-run precision and accuracy in QC samples were determined from 0.9 to 4.9 and −2.0 to -0.5 on 2-hydroxyatorvastatin, respectively, and from 2.1 to 2.8 and −1.9 to 5.0 on atorvastatin lactone, respectively. Based on back-calculated concentration, the between-run precision and accuracy were in a range of 0.5–2.4 and −0.8–0.8 on 2-hydroxyatorvastatin and 1.2–3.7 and -3.8–4.5 on atorvastatin lactone, respectively.\\nThe PK profiles of atorvastatin and its metabolites were evaluated based on the following parameters: the maximum plasma concentration (Css,max) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUCτ) at steady state for each analyte, time to Css,max (Tss,max) for atorvastatin, and metabolic ratio for atorvastatin metabolites. The PK parameters were obtained directly from the data or estimated by a non-compartmental method using MATLAB SimBiology. The descriptive statistics for the PK parameters were summarized by the intervention, and the comparison of PK parameters was performed on Css,max and AUCτ. Log-transformed Css,max and AUCτ values were assessed by a mixed-effects model. The model defined sequence, group, period nested in group and intervention as fixed effects and subject as a random effect, where the cluster of subjects studied at one time was reflected in the group effect. Intervention R was considered a reference in this analysis, and no adjustment was made for multiple comparisons unless otherwise specified. Subject characteristics and adverse events (AEs) were also summarized. The changes in serum gastrin, pepsinogen I and II levels were compared by mixed-effects model with Tukey-Kramer method. To explore the effect of co-administered with tegoprazan or vonoprazan on the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering effect of atorvastatin, the changes of LDL-C were compared between the interventions by mixed-effects model and the post-hoc analysis was performed using Tukey-Kramer method. Statistical analysis was carried out using SAS Enterprise Guide (Version 7.1; SAS Institute Inc., NC, United States) with a significance level of 0.05.\\nA total of 32 subjects were enrolled, and 28 subjects completed the study (Figure 1). One subject withdrew the consent before the investigational product administration, and 3 subjects discontinued the study due to AEs (2 subjects) and the physician decision (1 subject). Twenty-eight subjects, who had complete PK profiles, were included for PK analysis and safety was analyzed in 31 subjects (31 subjects in intervention R1, 28 subjects in intervention R2, 30 subjects in intervention T, and 29 subjects in intervention V) who had received any intervention at least once. The mean (±standard deviation) values of age, weight, height, and body mass index (BMI) of the 32 enrolled subjects were 33.9 (±9.6)\\xa0years, 71.1 (±8.1)\\xa0cm, 174.6 (±6.0)\\xa0kg, and 23.3 (±2.6)\\xa0kg/m2. The demographic characteristics were similar among the allocation groups.\\nMean plasma concentration profiles of atorvastatin when atorvastatin was administered alone and co-administered with vonoprazan or tegoprazan are shown in Figure 2A. For better visual inspection of the absorption phase of atorvastatin, the mean plasma concentration profiles of atorvastatin up to 4\\xa0h are represented in Figure 2B.\\nWhen atorvastatin was co-administered with vonoprazan, the Css,max of atorvastatin increased by 17% and AUCτ of atorvastatin increased by 28% compared to those when atorvastatin was administered alone (Table 2). Although the systemic exposure of atorvastatin increased, the Css,max and AUCτ of 2-hydroxyatorvastatin decreased by 30 and 9%, respectively, when atorvastatin was co-administered with vonoprazan compared to those when administered alone (Supplementary Table S1). The mean plasma concentration profiles up to 4\\xa0h showed that 2-hydroxyatorvastatin was formed more slowly than when atorvastatin was administered alone (Figure 3A). The Css,max and AUCτ of atorvastatin lactone increased by 32 and 29% respectively when atorvastatin was co-administered with vonoprazan compared to those when atorvastatin was administered alone (Supplementary Table S1). The noticeable increase of Css,max of atorvastatin lactone was also observed in the mean plasma concentration profiles up to 4\\xa0h (Figure 3B). However, the metabolic ratio of atorvastatin lactone was similar between the intervention groups since the systemic exposure of atorvastatin lactone increased to a similar extent to that of atorvastatin (Table 1).\\nWhen atorvastatin was co-administered with tegoprazan, the Css,max and AUCτ of atorvastatin were similar to those when atorvastatin was administered alone (Table 1, Table 2). Moreover, there was no difference in the mean plasma concentration profiles of atorvastatin up to 4\\xa0h (Figure 2B). The Css,max and AUCτ of 2-hydroxyatorvastatin and atorvastatin lactone were similar regardless of the tegoprazan co-administration (Supplementary Table S1).\\nA total of 42 treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) was reported in 22 (68.8%) of the 31 subjects. Seven TEAEs occurred in 6 subjects (19.4%) in the intervention R1, and 8 TEAEs occurred in 7 subjects (25.5%) in the intervention R2. Ten TEAEs occurred in 7 subjects (23.3%) in the intervention T, and 17 TEAEs occurred in 15 subjects (51.7%) in the intervention V. Two subjects discontinued the study due to AEs (neutropenia for 1 subject in the intervention T, blood creatine phosphokinase increased for 1subject in the intervention R). Among the 42 TEAEs, 3 TEAEs were moderate, and 1 TEAE (blood creatine phosphokinase increased) was severe in intensity while the others were mild. Of the 42 TEAEs, 33 cases were evaluated as possibly related to the intervention.\\nFrequently reported TEAEs were hypergastrinemia (6 cases), blood bilirubin increased (6 cases), and pyuria (5 cases). Hypergastrinemia, defined by a serum gastrin level greater than 200\\xa0ng/L, only occurred when atorvastatin was co-administered with vonoprazan. The serum gastrin, pepsinogen I and II levels overall increased after the administration of tegoprazan or vonoprazan compared to the baseline (Figure 4). The increase of mean serum gastrin after the co-administration of vonoprazan was significantly different compared to other interventions (T vs. V, p < 0.001; R vs. V, p < 0.001). Additionally, there were significant differences in the extent of the increase in the serum pepsinogen I and II between vonoprazan and tegoprazan (p < 0.001 for pepsinogen I; p < 0.001 for pepsinogen II). Meanwhile, the changes of LDL-C were not significantly different between the interventions (R vs. T, p = 0.347; R vs. V, p = 0.872; T vs. V, p = 0.858).\\nThe number of subjects with TEAEs when atorvastatin was administered alone (6 subjects in Reference 1 and 7 subjects in Reference 2) was similar to when atorvastatin was co-administered with tegoprazan (7 subjects). However, when atorvastatin was co-administered with vonoprazan, more subjects (15 subjects) reported TEAEs than those when atorvastatin was administered alone (Table 3). There were no clinically significant changes in vital signs, physical examinations, and 12-lead ECGs.\\nThis study investigated whether the concomitant administration of atorvastatin with P-CABs, tegoprazan or vonoprazan, influences the PK of atorvastatin and safety profile. Atorvastatin was known as a highly variable drug with a within-subject CV of more than 30%. Based on the previous replicate crossover studies of atorvastatin, the within-subject CV of Cmax and AUC were 39–45% and 17–23%, respectively. In the case of highly variable drugs such as atorvastatin, some regulatory agencies recommend a full or partial replicated crossover design. Therefore, this study was designed as a partial replicated crossover study where subjects received intervention R twice and received intervention T and V once. In this study, the within-subject CV of Css,max and AUCτ of atorvastatin were 33.6 and 11% (data not shown), slightly smaller than those of previous studies (38–44.1% for Cmax and 16.7–15.5% for AUC). This difference might be mainly due to multiple doses of atorvastatin for 7\\xa0days, reducing the within-subject variability. The high variability in the plasma concentrations of atorvastatin, especially in the absorption phase, was also observed in other studies with similar standard deviations.\\nAtorvastatin is orally administered in the hydroxy acid ring form and interconverted to the inactive lactone form, and both forms are metabolized to hydroxylated forms by CYP3A4. In this study, co-administration of atorvastatin with vonoprazan increased the systemic exposure of atorvastatin and decreased the systemic exposure of 2-hydroxyatorvastatin, resulting in a significant decrease in the metabolic ratio of 2-hydroxyatorvastatin. When atorvastatin was co-administered with vonoprazan, 2-hydroxyatorvastatin was formed relatively slower than when atorvastatin was administered alone. In addition, the slopes of the elimination phase in the log-linear profiles were similar among all the intervention groups. Considering the high permeability of atorvastatin, the changes in the PK of atorvastatin reflected the changes in the activity of CYP3A4 which is independent of the permeability. The IC50 values of CYP3A4 for tegoprazan and vonoprazan were >30 and 29\\xa0μM, respectively, and the expected plasma concentrations of tegoprazan and vonoprazan when administered at clinical doses are 25-fold lower than the IC50. However, when vonoprazan 20\\xa0mg is orally administered, the intestinal luminal concentration of vonoprazan is estimated to be approximately 232\\xa0μM that is 8-fold higher than the IC50 for vonoprazan. Vonoprazan with high luminal concentrations may inhibit the intestinal CYP3A4, thus increasing the systemic exposure of orally administered atorvastatin. Similarly, some clinical studies revealed that concurrent use of statins with CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as protease inhibitors and diltiazem, inhibited the intestinal CYP3A4 increasing systemic exposure of atorvastatin or simvastatin. These results indicated that vonoprazan would inhibit the intestinal CYP3A4, not the hepatic CYP3A4.\\nThe atorvastatin lactone form is inactive in the effect of lowering lipid. However, a recent study suggested that atorvastatin lactone might contribute to the occurrence of muscular adverse events such as myopathy. Therefore, the effect of co-administration with tegoprazan or vonoprazan on the systemic exposure of atorvastatin lactone should be considered. The atorvastatin lactone is formed by uridine diphosphate–glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1 and UGT1A3 and sequentially metabolized to 2-, 4-hydroxyatorvastatin lactone by CYP3A4. In this study, the systemic exposure of atorvastatin lactone significantly increased when atorvastatin was co-administered with vonoprazan. This increase implies that vonoprazan could inhibit CYP3A4 which involves the formation of 2-, 4-hydroxyatorvastatin lactone. In contrast to 2-hydroxyatorvastatin, the metabolic ratio of atorvastatin lactone was similar between all intervention groups. According to this study, it is confirmed that vonoprazan and tegoprazan do not affect UGT1A1 and UGT1A3.\\nThe liver-specific transporter OATP1B1, uptaking endogenous compounds and drugs into hepatocytes, plays an important role in eliminating atorvastatin and its metabolites. The endogenous bile acid derivative bilirubin is one of the substrates of OATP1B1 like atorvastatin. Co-administration of atorvastatin with OATP1B1 inhibitors increased the systemic exposure of atorvastatin and induced transient hyperbilirubinemia. Although tegoprazan showed the inhibitory activity on some OATP1B1 substrates in a non-clinical study, the systemic exposure of the substrates would not significantly increase considering the maximum concentration of tegoprazan at clinical doses. In this study, when atorvastatin was co-administered with tegoprazan, the Css,max and AUCτ of atorvastatin increased by 9 and 3%, respectively. These increases were not clinically significant since none of them were statistically significant and the within-subject CVs of the Css,max and AUCτ of atorvastatin are known to be high. Thus tegoprazan would not have any effect on OATP1B1 at clinical dose. Also, the in vitro study showed that vonoprazan did not inhibit OATP1B1. The increase in the blood bilirubin in this study was similar regardless of whether atorvastatin was administered alone or in combination with P-CABs. Accordingly, the increase of the systemic exposure of atorvastatin co-administered with vonoprazan in this study resulted from inhibiting CYP3A4, not attributed to the inhibition of OATP1B1.\\nIt is important whether the changes of PK by drug-drug interactions affect the efficacy. The dose-response of atorvastatin generally shows a log-linear profile, but the PK is not directly correlated with the LDL-C lowering effect of atorvastatin. As expected, the changes of serum LDL-C levels were not statistically different between the interventions in this study. However, further studies are needed to determine the impact of these interactions on LDL-C levels in patients with dyslipidemia since this study was conducted in healthy adults.\\nSome studies showed that serum gastrin, pepsinogen I and II increased after P-CAB treatment, and hypergastrinemia could be observed frequently when PPIs, including P-CABs, are administered. Given the mechanism of action of the PPIs and subsequent physiological feedback increasing serum gastrin to lower gastric pH, hypergastrinemia can be predictable. Nonetheless, the serum gastrin increased only 1.2 times higher when atorvastatin was co-administered with tegoprazan. Similarly, other studies reported that tegoprazan as well as other gastric acid inhibitors did not compensatively increase the serum gastrin level. The mechanism by which tegoprazan does not increase the serum gastrin level has not yet been elucidated.\\nThe gastrin stimulates the pepsinogen release from chief cells and the increase of pepsinogen I and II is predictable. In this study, the levels of pepsinogen I and II significantly increased when atorvastatin was co-administered with tegoprazan or vonoprazan compared to when atorvastatin was administered alone. However, when atorvastatin was co-administered with vonoprazan, the increases in serum pepsinogen I and II were much greater than those when atorvastatin was co-administered with tegoprazan (5.6 and 5.4 times with vonoprazan, respectively; 2.7 and 2.2 times with tegoprazan). Although the serum gastrin level did not significantly increase when atorvastatin was co-administered with tegoprazan, the serum pepsinogen I and II level could increase since the release of pepsinogen is effectively stimulated by other factors such as cholecystokinin.\\nThe increased blood bilirubin was also frequently observed in this study. Regardless of whether tegoprazan or vonoprazan was co-administered, this might be associated with the administration of atorvastatin. Although the incidence of TEAEs between those of atorvastatin administered alone and co-administered with tegoprazan was similar, more subjects reported TEAEs when atorvastatin was co-administered with vonoprazan. Except for the hypergastrinemia, the safety and tolerability profiles were similar among the interventions. Myopathy, which might progress to life-threatening rhabdomyolysis, is one of the remarkable adverse effects of atorvastatin. Although the mechanism of statin-induced muscle adverse events is not fully understood, the risk of the adverse events is thought to be associated with the systemic exposure of statin, especially atorvastatin lactone and 4-hydroxyatorvastatin. The co-administration of CYP3A4 inhibitors with atorvastatin showed a higher risk of muscular adverse events such as myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. Therefore, the further assessment that the co-administration of atorvastatin with vonoprazan potentially inhibits intestinal CYP3A4 should be conducted in terms of the efficacy and the adverse events.\\nIn conclusion, the systemic exposure of atorvastatin and hypergastrinemia incidence increased after multiple doses of atorvastatin co-administered with vonoprazan in healthy subjects. There was no evidence of significant interactions when atorvastatin was co-administered with tegoprazan.\\nThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/Supplementary Material, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author.\\nThe studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by the institutional review board (IRB) at Samsung Medical Center (Seoul, Republic of Korea) and the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety.

       "    'fulltext': 'Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are widely used as relatively safe drugs for gastric acid-related disease. However, various adverse events (AEs) of long-term PPI use have been reported, including absorption disorders, Clostridium difficile infection, chronic pneumonia, and microscopic enteritis. Hypomagnesemia due to PPI was first reported in 2006; thereafter, similar studies have been performed.\\nVonoprazan has a strong inhibitory effect on gastric acid secretion through a mechanism different from that of PPIs. It was introduced for use in Japan in 2015. To date, only a few reports have described AEs associated with vonoprazan, although AEs similar to those caused by PPIs can occur due to the suppression of gastric acid secretion. We herein report a case of hypomagnesemia caused by the long-term use of vonoprazan.\\nA 66-year-old man with a history of myocardial infarction and cerebral infarction was admitted to our hospital because of disturbances in gait and consciousness. He had undergone endovascular aortic repair for abdominal aortic aneurysm at 64 years old; at that time, he had been taking a PPI until it was changed to vonoprazan. Approximately four months after that operation, he experienced sudden clonic convulsion. Although his electroencephalography findings were normal, he was diagnosed with symptomatic epilepsy associated with old cerebral infarction, and levetiracetam was started. The serum calcium (Ca) level at this time was slightly low at 7.2 mg/dL (albumin-corrected Ca 7.5 mg/dL), and the serum Mg level was not measured.\\nAt two months before admission, he presented with diarrhea and appetite loss. Forty-three days before admission, he visited our emergency department with convulsions and disturbance of consciousness. Although blood tests revealed electrolyte abnormalities in serum magnesium (0.4 mg/dL), potassium (2.66 mEq/L), and albumin-corrected Ca (6.9 mg/dL), he left our hospital because his symptoms improved spontaneously. He gradually became unable to walk, and he was ultimately admitted to our hospital due to disturbance of consciousness. He had no history of alcohol consumption and was an ex-smoker with a 30-pack/year history before quitting at 64 years old. He was taking vonoprazan, levetiracetam, clopidogrel, diltiazem, telmisartan, amlodipine, nicorandil, bisoprolol, and isosorbide dinitrate.\\nOn a physical examination at hospitalization, his heart rate was 109 beats per minute, blood pressure was 124/75 mmHg, and body temperature was 36.6℃. Although his consciousness was disturbed, as he was in a semi-comatose state, he gradually recovered after arriving at the hospital. He did not have typical symptoms of tetany. Computed tomography of the head did not reveal novel findings other than an old cerebral infarction, and no abnormalities were found on electroencephalography. The electrocardiogram results were also almost normal.\\nLaboratory examinations showed a serum magnesium level of 0.2 mg/dL, potassium of 3.0 mEq/L and albumin-corrected Ca of 5.7 mg/dL (Table). Serum intact-parathyroid hormone, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, and calcitonin levels were all within normal ranges. The blood ammonia level was not measured. We considered his elevated serum CK level and lactic acidosis to indicate that the patient was having convulsions. These electrolyte disorders might have induced convulsions and conscious disturbance through symptomatic epilepsy.\\nWe initiated treatment to correct his magnesium levels intravenously and his Ca levels orally because his urinary magnesium excretion had decreased to 0.0 mg/dL, which indicated a poor oral intake. His serum magnesium levels increased to 2.0 mg/dL on the second admission day, and his consciousness improved (Figure). His serum Ca levels improved steadily, but his magnesium levels rapidly declined once intravenous administration was discontinued, even though he had a sufficient intake after hospitalization. In addition to a poor oral intake, we suspected that he had experienced magnesium malabsorption induced by long-term treatment with an antacid drug and vonoprazan, which had been used for over two years; vonoprazan was therefore ceased from the fifth admission day.\\nAlthough temporary intravenous administration of magnesium was needed again as serum magnesium decreased to 1.1 mg/dL on the 10th admission day, his serum magnesium level increased naturally to 1.6 mg/dL on day 20 after discontinuation of vonoprazan. An H2 antagonist was started instead of vonoprazan on the same day, and serum magnesium has not decreased again.\\nMagnesium is involved in various activities in the body, including energy metabolism, regulation of ion channels, and ATP metabolism in particular. Approximately 99% of magnesium exists in cells. Extracellular magnesium constitutes approximately 1% of the total amount, and serum magnesium is maintained in the range of 1.8-2.6 mg/dL. Magnesium in the body is dynamically regulated by its absorption from the intestine, exchange with bone, and excretion through the kidney. Magnesium deficiency causes serious symptoms, such as consciousness disorders, convulsions, and arrhythmia, and is often associated with hypokalemia and hypocalcemia due to hypoparathyroidism.\\nMagnesium deficiency results from dietary deprivation, gastrointestinal malabsorption, and increased renal excretion induced by diuretics or nephrotoxic drugs or by hyperthyroidism or hypercalcemia. Recently, hypomagnesemia caused by the long-term use of PPIs has also been reported.\\nThe divalent cation channels transient receptor potential melastatin ion channel (TRPM) 6 and TRPM7 are strongly involved in magnesium homeostasis. Intracellular magnesium is maintained at a constant concentration compared with the fluctuating extracellular magnesium level because TRPM7, which is widely distributed in the body, regulates the influx of magnesium into the cells. The presence of TRPM6 in the apical membrane of enterocytes is critical for the active absorption of magnesium. TRPM6 requires the cooperation of TRPM7 and forms the TRPM6/7 complex. Under normal dietary conditions in healthy individuals, 30-50% of magnesium is absorbed mainly from the distal jejunum and the ileum. Approximately 90% of magnesium passively passes through the paracellular pathway between the enterocytes via a concentration gradient, and the remainder is actively absorbed through the intracellular pathway. When the luminal magnesium concentration is low, active transport by TRPM6/7 is important for magnesium absorption.\\nThere have been numerous reports of hypomagnesemia due to PPI treatment since 2006. A PPI acts not only on the H+/K+-adenosinetriphosphatase (ATPase) of gastric parietal cells to suppress H+ secretion into the gastric lumen but also on the gastric-type H+/K+-ATPase present in pancreatic duct epithelial cells to suppress H+ secretion into the pancreatic duct. Because this reduces the intracellular pH, HCO3 secretion from cells is also suppressed to maintain intracellular acid-base equilibrium. Thus, the secretion HCO3-rich pancreatic juice into the pancreatic duct is suppressed. Generally, the use of antacid drugs is followed by an increase in intestinal pH. However, with long-term use of PPIs, the intestinal pH is decreased because H+ influx from the stomach is not neutralized by adequate secretion of pancreatic juice. H+ ions promote the influx of monovalent cations, such as sodium, and generate an inward current by competing with divalent cations, such as magnesium and calcium, through TRPM7. For this reason, increased H+ in the intestine due to continuous use of PPIs is thought to disturb the influx of magnesium ions into the cell, causing magnesium deficiency.\\nVonoprazan, a potassium-competitive acid blocker (P-CAB), was introduced for use in Japan in 2015. The H+/K+-ATPase pump secretes H+ into the stomach, exchanging K+ through the lumen-facing conduit, and generates an ion flux, and P-CAB binds to its cation-binding site and competes with potassium ion to suppress gastric acid secretion. Although, there have been no reports of hypomagnesemia associated with P-CAB use, P-CAB is known to also act on the gastric H+/K+-ATPase in the pancreatic epithelium; therefore, it may inhibit magnesium absorption by a mechanism similar to that of a PPI, although further exploration will be needed.\\nHess et al. reported that the time from PPI administration to the onset of hypomagnesemia ranges from 14 days to 13 years, with a median time of 5.5 years, and most cases recover from hypomagnesemia by approximately 14 days after PPI discontinuation. Histamine-2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs) are commonly used as an alternative drug, and a study reported that H2RAs prevent recurrence of hypomagnesemia.\\nIn our patient, the active administration of electrolytes improved symptoms, but serum magnesium levels immediately decreased upon its discontinuation. We suspected that vonoprazan may have affected the magnesium absorption in addition to the poor oral intake, so the treatment was suspended. Consequently, the serum magnesium levels recovered nearly to the normal range by 10 days after cessation of vonoprazan. Hypomagnesemia did not recur with the administration of an H2RA for more than a year, so we concluded that vonoprazan was the cause of hypomagnesemia.\\nGenerally, because magnesium abundantly stored as hydroxyapatite in the bone is the first to be released when the plasma magnesium concentration is reduced, serum magnesium levels do not immediately decrease. In other words, the serum magnesium levels decrease only when the total stored magnesium has decreased considerably. A reduction in magnesium stores can easily lead to hypomagnesemia, especially in elderly patients with low magnesium stores due to aging. As mentioned above, the mechanism of active magnesium absorption by TRPM is affected by low luminal magnesium levels. Therefore, we suspected that symptomatic hypomagnesemia rapidly developed due to a combination of a poor oral intake in a patient with decreased magnesium stores secondary to gradual mechanisms, such as aging and long-term P-CAB use.\\nVarious AEs have been reported with long-term PPI use, including absorption disorders, C. difficile infection, and microscopic enteritis. Although similar AEs may occur with P-CAB treatment, to our knowledge, there have been no reports describing cases of hypomagnesemia, other than a case of collagenous colitis associated with vonoprazan use. We predict that reports of hypomagnesemia will increase in the future as interest in AEs associated with the long-term use of P-CAB grows and the population ages.\\nThe serum magnesium and calcium levels in the present patient were hardly ever measured despite the long-term use of vonoprazan for two years. Although PPIs and P-CAB are often continued in patients such as those with reflux esophagitis, their side effects should be thoroughly monitored, and their aimless long-term administration should be avoided.\\n The authors state that they have no Conflict of Interest (COI).

       "    'fulltext': \"Nonerosive reflux disease (NERD) is common in Western and Asian countries such as Japan and is associated with a significant burden on patient life and on health care systems. The clinically relevant goal for NERD treatment is to relieve acid reflux symptoms (i.e., heartburn), and the first-line treatment is proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). Despite their well-documented clinical efficacy and safety, PPIs display several limitations, one of which is that only ∼50%–60% of patients with NERD achieve symptom resolution by 4 weeks. Therefore, there is an unmet need for novel drugs to improve outcomes in patients with NERD.\\nUnlike conventional PPIs, vonoprazan fumarate (Takecab or Vocinti, Takeda, Osaka, Japan) competitively inhibits H+, K+ -ATPase by binding to the potassium ion binding site and does not require activation by gastric acid. Vonoprazan has been approved in Japan for the treatment of gastric and duodenal ulcers, healing of reflux esophagitis and prevention of relapse, secondary prevention of low-dose aspirin– or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug–induced gastric mucosal damage, and first- and second-line Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy. For NERD, a previous randomized controlled study in Japanese patients did not demonstrate the superiority of vonoprazan 10 mg to placebo. Several reasons for this have been posited, including the symptom scale for assessing heartburn used in the study and inappropriate patient selection (i.e, inclusion of patients with heartburn unrelated to acid reflux, such as functional dyspepsia or functional heartburn).\\nTo address these questions, we have conducted this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in Japanese patients with NERD. The study objectives were to assess the safety and efficacy of vonoprazan 10 mg, compared with placebo, on heartburn symptoms (assessed by proportion of days without heartburn and cumulative improvement rates of heartburn) during 4 weeks of treatment.\\nThis was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial of oral once-daily vonoprazan 10 mg compared with placebo in adults with NERD. The study was registered (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02954848), approved by the local institutional review board, and conducted at 44 study sites in Japan (November 2016–February 2018) in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, the International Conference on Harmonisation Guideline for Good Clinical Practice, and applicable Japanese regulations. All patients signed the informed consent form before participation.\\nIncluded patients were aged 20 years and older, with an endoscopic diagnosis of NERD grade N (normal mucosa) or M (minimal changes to the mucosa, e.g., erythema and/or whitish turbidity) (Modified Los Angeles Classification) and recurrent heartburn (≥2 d/wk for the past 3 weeks), and if, during the run-in period, they had demonstrated compliance (≥75%) with study drug administration, had heartburn (≥2 days), and had completed all required information in the patient diary. Recurrent heartburn was defined as a burning sensation arising from the stomach or behind the breastbone, which commonly appeared/was exacerbated postprandially or when bending forward or during abdominal compression. The endoscopic severity of NERD was assessed by the investigators and was confirmed by a Central Adjudication Committee.\\nPatients were excluded if they had a history of suspected functional upper gastrointestinal disorders (e.g., functional dyspepsia, diagnosed by the Rome IV criteria), long-segment Barrett's esophagus (≥3 cm), any upper gastrointestinal surgery or surgery that may affect gastroesophageal reflux, acute gastritis, acute esophageal bleeding or gastric/duodenal ulcers, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, or concurrent upper gastrointestinal symptoms more severe than heartburn.\\nFull inclusion/exclusion criteria are available at www.clinicaltrials.gov.\\nAll concomitant medications, including vitamin supplements, over-the-counter drugs, and herbal medicines, were recorded. Excluded medications were PPIs, H2-receptor antagonists, prokinetics, anticholinergics, prostaglandins, antacids, antigastrin drugs, mucosal protective agents, triple therapy for H. pylori eradication, atazanavir sulfate, rilpivirine hydrochloride, antidepressants, anxiolytics, and investigational or postmarketing study products.\\nIn the run-in period, patients underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and received 1 week of placebo treatment in a single blinded manner. Subsequently, eligible patients were randomized 1:1 (stratified according to their grade N or M) to receive 1 tablet of vonoprazan 10 mg or placebo orally once daily after breakfast for 4 weeks. Patients were followed up at weeks 2 and 4. Treatment compliance was assessed using patient diaries and examination of the study drug container. The patient was to be withdrawn from the study if the compliance rate was <50% for 2 successive visits.\\nThe sample size was calculated using the patient numbers required for efficacy evaluations in each grade group and the proportion of days without heartburn determined in previous studies of lansoprazole (mean ± SD: lansoprazole 15 mg 63.2% ± 32.20% vs placebo 51.0% ± 28.39%) and vonoprazan (vonoprazan 10 mg 28.9% ± 34.85% vs placebo 22.6% ± 28.20%). Enrollment of patients with either grade N or M ended when the number of enrolled patients with each grade exceeded 332 or 70% of the total planned number of patients. Assuming that the difference between treatment groups would be 10% with a common SD of 32%, 230 patients per treatment group were required to ensure 90% power of the 2-sample Wilcoxon rank-sum test to verify the intergroup difference with a significance level of 0.05. Assuming a 3% dropout, 237 patients per treatment group were required.\\nEligible patients were randomized to the study drugs according to the medication identification number allocated to each study site. The sponsor randomization personnel or designee generated the randomization schedule using block randomization. All randomization information was stored in a secured area and accessible only by authorized personnel.\\nVonoprazan and placebo tablets were indistinguishable from each other. Patients, investigators, and all study personnel remained blinded to the randomized treatment assignments until the database lock. Emergency code keys were kept by the Emergency Key Control Center and only broken during an emergency or after database lock. Serum gastrin and pepsinogen I/II levels were not disclosed during the data collection period.\\nPrimary efficacy outcome was the frequency of heartburn experienced by patients during the 4-week treatment period as measured by the proportion of days without heartburn. The patients recorded their daily heartburn symptoms from waking to bedtime and their compliance with the study treatment.\\nSecondary outcomes were the cumulative improvement rates of heartburn, and the proportion of days without heartburn in patient subgroups as stratified by response to treatment (improved, not improved) at week 2, baseline endoscopic findings (grade N/M), or a combination of endoscopic findings and response at week 2. Improvement at week 2 was defined as heartburn on <2 of the 7 days before week 2 (criterion 1) or a lower proportion of days with heartburn up to week 2 than during the run-in period (criterion 2). An independent central evaluation committee reviewed all endoscopic assessments reported by the sites in a consistent manner. In addition, the proportion of patients without heartburn or no hindrance to daily activities in the fourth week of the treatment period was assessed in a post hoc analysis.\\nThe type and frequency of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs; coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities version 20.0 for analysis) and serious adverse events were assessed continuously. Serum chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis findings, serum gastrin and pepsinogen I/II concentrations, and vital signs and electrocardiogram results were recorded at each study visit.\\nThree analysis sets were defined in this study: the full analysis set (FAS), per-protocol set (PPS), and safety analysis set. The FAS and safety analysis set included all randomized patients who received ≥1 dose of study drug. The PPS included all patients in the FAS who had available measurements for the primary variable, a prespecified minimal exposure to the treatment regimen, and no major protocol violations.\\nThe primary and secondary efficacy end points were analyzed in the FAS. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the proportion of days without heartburn during the treatment period by treatment group. A Hodges-Lehmann estimation was used to estimate the median difference between treatment groups, and a 2-sample Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used for comparison between treatment groups. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the cumulative improvement rates of heartburn during the treatment period for each treatment group. The event date was defined as the first confirmed date of heartburn improvement that continued until the last day of study treatment. The censoring date was defined as 6 days before the last day with documentation of whether the patients experienced heartburn (applicable only to patients without symptom improvement). A log-rank test was used to compare the cumulative improvement rates of heartburn between treatment groups. The frequency of the proportion of days without heartburn for each treatment group was presented in a histogram. A sensitivity analysis for primary end points was performed in the PPS to confirm the robustness of the analysis.\\nFor all analyses, 2-sided 95% confidence intervals for median between-group differences were calculated.\\nFor the proportion of patients without heartburn or no hindrance to daily activities in the fourth week of the treatment period, the point estimate and 2-sided 95% confidence interval of the percentage difference were calculated between treatment groups, and a Fisher exact test was used for the comparison between treatment groups.\\nFor the safety end points, continuous variables (observed values and changes from study drug start) were summarized by treatment group for each visit using descriptive statistics. For categorical variables, shift tables in each category before and after treatment for the treatment period postbaseline visit were provided for each treatment group.\\nAll available efficacy and safety data were included in data listing and tabulations. No imputation of values for missing data was performed unless otherwise specified. For clinical laboratory tests, values less than the quantification's lower limit were treated as zero when calculating the descriptive statistics.\\nThe same analyses were performed in the subgroups. Analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC).\\nOf 721 patients who gave informed consent, 484 were randomized for treatment; however, 1 patient in the vonoprazan group did not receive the study drug and was excluded from the FAS (placebo 245; vonoprazan 238) (Figure 1). No obvious differences were observed between treatment groups at baseline (Table 1).\\nCompared with placebo, treatment with vonoprazan improved the proportion of days without symptoms of heartburn during the treatment period and significantly increased cumulative improvement rates of heartburn. Although the proportion of days without heartburn during the treatment period was not statistically different between treatment groups in the FAS (primary end point, P = 0.0643), this was significantly higher with vonoprazan than with placebo (P = 0.0341) in the sensitivity analysis comprising the PPS population (Table 2). Differences in the cumulative improvement rates of heartburn during the treatment period between treatment groups were statistically significant (P = 0.0003, log-rank test) (Figure 2). The difference was observed after 1 day of treatment and maintained throughout the treatment period. In addition, the distribution pattern indicated a shift in the vonoprazan group to a higher proportion of days without heartburn during the treatment period compared with the placebo group (Figure 3). In a post hoc analysis, the proportion of patients without heartburn or no hindrance to daily activities in the fourth week of the treatment period was significantly higher with vonoprazan than with placebo (P = 0.0023) (see Table, Supplementary Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/CTG/A115).\\nThe improvement in heartburn symptoms by week 2 was associated with a greater proportion of days without heartburn during the treatment period in the vonoprazan group compared with the placebo group (P < 0.05), regardless of the improvement criteria used (see Table, Supplementary Digital Content 2, http://links.lww.com/CTG/A115).\\nBy contrast, no differences between treatment groups were noted when patients were stratified by endoscopic grade (see Table, Supplementary Digital Content 2, http://links.lww.com/CTG/A115).\\nIn patients with grade M, improvement in heartburn symptoms by week 2 (criterion 1) was associated with a greater proportion of days without heartburn during the treatment period in the vonoprazan group compared with the placebo group (P < 0.05); however, this was not observed for patients with improvement defined by criterion 2 (see Table, Supplementary Digital Content 2, http://links.lww.com/CTG/A115). In patients with grade N, improvement in heartburn symptoms using criterion 2 was associated with significantly greater treatment response for vonoprazan compared with placebo.\\nOver the treatment period, the overall incidences of TEAEs, drug-related TEAEs, and TEAEs leading to discontinuation were similar between the groups (Table 3). Most TEAEs were mild in intensity. One serious adverse event was recorded (colitis ulcerative, placebo group, occurred during the treatment period, unrelated to the study drug); no deaths were reported. Viral upper respiratory tract infection was the only TEAE reported with an incidence ≥2%; however, it was considered unrelated to the study drug. Mean levels of serum gastrin, pepsinogen I, and pepsinogen II increased after study drug administration in the vonoprazan group, while no clinically significant changes were observed in the placebo group (Table 4).\\nThis randomized, placebo-controlled trial has confirmed the efficacy and safety of vonoprazan 10 mg in patients with NERD. Although the results showed that vonoprazan was not superior to placebo in the FAS with respect to the proportion of days without heartburn, the superiority of vonoprazan to placebo was indicated in the PPS analysis. Furthermore, the study showed the rapid and sustained heartburn relief of vonoprazan compared with placebo. The safety profile of vonoprazan was comparable with placebo; most TEAEs were mild in severity.\\nThe study findings confirm and extend the results of the recent phase 3 trial reported by Kinoshita et al.. However, several differences between these 2 studies should be mentioned. Our study showed that vonoprazan 10 mg was superior to placebo in the PPS population, whereas in the previous study, vonoprazan 10 mg was not superior to placebo in the FAS or the PPS population (Kinoshita et al., unpublished data, 2016). Moreover, we found that vonoprazan significantly increased the cumulative improvement rates of heartburn during the treatment period compared with placebo, in contrast with the previous study. In our study, the cumulative improvement rate for vonoprazan was about 30% at 7 days, while in the previous study the cumulative improvement rate at 7 days was <10%. Looking at an even earlier time point (day 1), the improvement rate with vonoprazan in our study was already >20%. This more favorable response may be explained by the reduction of confounding factors in the previous study, such as the inclusion of patients with functional disorders, placebo responders, or the exclusion of patients who responded to antacids. Notably, in the current study, despite trying to exclude placebo responders, a higher proportion of days without heartburn and cumulative improvement rates of heartburn was observed in both vonoprazan and placebo groups, as expected in clinical trials with gastroesophageal reflux disease. Importantly, similar response rates were recorded in 2 retrospective studies conducted in Japan, where vonoprazan improved gastroesophageal reflux symptoms (symptomatic improvement rates were about 69% in patients with NERD).\\nCompared with the results from studies of rabeprazole or omeprazole, our study showed comparable results for the reduction of heartburn symptoms in the fourth week or the last week of the treatment period in patients with NERD. Patients receiving rabeprazole 10 mg had a significantly higher rate of complete resolution of heartburn compared with placebo in the fourth week or the last week of the 4-week treatment (44% vs 21%, P = 0.001). Similarly, the difference vs placebo in the rate of complete resolution of heartburn during week 4 with omeprazole 10 mg was 20% (P < 0.001), which is consistent with the rate of 14% (P = 0.0023) seen in our study. However, there were a number of patients who did not respond to vonoprazan (proportion of days without heartburn symptoms 0%) (Figure 3), suggesting that heartburn might not have been caused by acid reflux in these patients. Functional heartburn and esophageal dysmotility, which are known to be NERD-like symptoms that respond poorly to acid suppressants, occur in Japanese patients with NERD; hence, it is possible that these patients were not completely excluded from our study.\\nResponse to vonoprazan treatment at 2 weeks may predict response at 4 weeks, which was similar to the findings reported in Kinoshita et al.. Baseline endoscopic grade was not predictive of response at 4 weeks; these findings are consistent with those of other studies conducted in Japan with vonoprazan 10 mg or omeprazole. Thus, response to treatment at 2 weeks may be useful in deciding whether to continue the course of treatment or identify an alternate therapy.\\nIt remains unclear whether the response to acid-reducing treatments such as vonoprazan or conventional PPIs differs between grade M or N NERD. Results from our study showed that although there was no significant difference between treatment groups for the proportions of days without heartburn, there were similar proportions of days without heartburn observed in patients who were receiving vonoprazan with different grades of NERD (grade M 67.90%, grade N 76.70%, see Table, Supplementary Digital Content 2, http://links.lww.com/CTG/A115). Similarly, a previous study reported no significant difference between vonoprazan 10 mg and placebo for the proportions of days without heartburn in patients with grade M or N NERD. The results for vonoprazan are similar to those reported for omeprazole. These data suggest that the categories of grade M or grade N may not be relevant with reducing heartburn symptoms.\\nThe safety data reported in the current study are consistent with those of other studies with vonoprazan. Most TEAEs were classified as mild in intensity. Consistent with the mechanism of action of vonoprazan, and similar to PPIs, higher rates of gastroenteritis and increased serum gastrin, pepsinogen I, and pepsinogen II levels were observed after vonoprazan administration.\\nStrengths of the study include its prospective, randomized, controlled design with a run-in period that could reduce the known placebo effect observed in studies with PPIs for gastroesophageal reflux disease treatment; the absence of antacid use during the run-in period that reflects clinical practice in NERD treatment and avoids excluding antacid responders; the use of a vonoprazan dose and duration that reflect clinical practice for NERD in Japan; and the inclusion of patients with endoscopically confirmed NERD. Finally, a study-specific committee comprising independent experts in endoscopic grading of NERD ensured that the endoscopic diagnosis was confirmed in a consistent manner. Limitations of the study include its non–active-controlled design, the lack of a validated patient-reported outcome instrument for heartburn symptoms, and the generalizability of the study to non-Japanese populations. The placebo-controlled design was selected for study feasibility because large variability in the evaluation of NERD would make the sensitivity of this study unreliable if conducted with an active-controlled noninferiority design. Since NERD is influenced by diet, lifestyle, and obesity, the effect of vonoprazan in other populations will need to be investigated.\\nIn conclusion, although the FAS analysis showed that vonoprazan 10 mg was not superior to placebo with respect to the proportion of days without heartburn in patients with NERD, the PPS sensitivity analysis showed a significantly greater improvement in the vonoprazan group compared with placebo on this end point. In addition, vonoprazan delivered rapid relief from heartburn symptoms, had a significantly higher cumulative rate of heartburn resolution, and was well tolerated. The partial response of vonoprazan monotherapy in this study may be explained by the heterogeneous pathophysiology of NERD.\\nGuarantor of the article: Yoshikazu Kinoshita, MD, PhD.\\nSpecific author contributions: All authors participated in the interpretation of study results and in the drafting, critical revision, and approval of the final version of the manuscript.

       "    'fulltext': 'Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD), an advanced endoscopic procedure, has become an alternative to surgical resection for early gastric cancer. However, this technique causes artificial ulceration, which can be linked to delayed bleeding from the ulcer. This is a well-known complication of ESD. It is generally recommended to administer a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) after ESD, because the inhibition of gastric acid secretion can improve the healing of ESD-induced ulcers. However, PPIs have several limitations, such as short plasma half-life, slow onset of effects, and problems related to cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19 polymorphism.\\nRecently, a novel potassium-competitive acid-blocking agent (P-CAB) called vonoprazan (TAKECAB; Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), has been developed that is stronger, faster, and exhibits longer-lasting acid suppression than conventional PPIs. The acid-inhibitory effect of vonoprazan has been reported to be more potent than that of PPIs, with greater impact against acid-related diseases such as gastroesophageal reflux disease or Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) infection.\\nVonoprazan may have an efficacy comparable to or better than that of PPIs in the treatment of artificial ulcers resulting from ESD. Therefore, vonoprazan has been preferred in the management of ESD-induced artificial ulcers. There is a growing number of reports comparing the effectiveness of vonoprazan with that of PPIs in treating ESD-induced ulcers. However, the findings have been variable, and reported outcomes are conflicting. Furthermore, no previous systematic review and meta-analysis has been published regarding this issue. Therefore, we have performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess and compare the effects of vonoprazan and PPI in the treatment of ESD-induced artificial ulcers and prevention of delayed bleeding in randomized clinical trials (RCT) and cohort studies.\\nWe developed the protocol for this review and registered it in the international prospective register of systematic reviews PROSPERO network (registration number: CRD42018091656; www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO).\\nThe described systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted in accordance with the protocol recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration and with the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines. It was reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines.\\nThis systematic review does not require ethical approval or informed consent because there was no direct contact with individual patients, and only previously published data were included in the review.\\nTwo authors (KBJ and CGJ) independently searched OVID-MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and Google Scholar in April 2018. We also searched registered trials described in clinical trial registries, which are listed in the Appendix (see Supplemental Digital Content, which shows worldwide clinical trial registries that we searched for).\\nThe search terms included vonoprazan, Takecab, P-CAB, TAK-438, potassium-competitive, endoscopic submucosal dissection, and ESD. The reference lists of the identified studies and eligible articles were also searched manually in order to identify additional relevant studies.\\nStudies included in our analysis were selected based on the following inclusion criteria: study design (SD), randomized clinical trial or cohort study; patients (P), patients who underwent ESD for gastric adenoma or a possible node-negative early gastric cancer; intervention (I), anti-ulcer medication with potassium-competitive acid blocker including vonoprazan; comparator (C), anti-ulcer medication with PPI including lansoprazole, esomeprazole, or rabeprazole; and outcome (O), primary outcomes including ulcer healing rate at 4 weeks and 8 weeks after ESD, and secondary outcomes including shrinkage rate and ulcer size at 4 weeks and 8 weeks after ESD, and delayed bleeding event. No language or date restrictions were applied.\\nReview articles, case reports, case-series, letters to editor, commentaries, laboratory science studies, and any non-relevant studies were excluded from analysis.\\nInclusion and exclusion criteria for the selection of studies were determined before systematic search. In the first stage, 2 authors (KBJ and KH) independently excluded irrelevant articles by examining the titles and abstracts of the articles identified by the variety of search strategies described above. If the report was determined eligible based on the title or abstract, the full article was retrieved. Full-text versions of potentially relevant studies, as determined by at least 1 author, were retrieved and evaluated in the second stage of study selection. The articles that met the inclusion criteria were assessed separately by 2 authors (KBJ and KH), and any discrepancies were resolved through discussion. If consensus could not be reached, the dispute was resolved with the help of the third investigator (KJG). When the study samples overlapped in ≥2 articles, we selected the article with the most comprehensive population. For studies with insufficient or missing data, we attempted to contact the authors. If this was unsuccessful, we extrapolated data from the text or tables, or when possible, made calculations using relevant data given in the study.\\nUsing a data extraction form that had been developed in advance, 2 reviewers (CGJ and KBJ) independently extracted the following information: first author, year of publication, study design, country, study period, publication language, anti-ulcer medication, endoscopic measurement, ulcer healing rate, shrinkage rate, ulcer size at 4 weeks and 8 weeks after ESD, and delayed bleeding event.\\nThe quality of the studies was independently assessed by the same 2 reviewers (KBJ and KH) using the “risk of bias” tool in case of RCTs and the Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS) in case of cohort studies. Quality assessment was performed only for peer-reviewed articles.\\nRisk of bias (ROB) was evaluated by considering the following 7 potential sources of bias: random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of the participants, blinding of the outcome assessors, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting, and other bias. The methodology of each trial was graded as “high,” “low,\" or “unclear,\" to reflect a high ROB, low ROB, and uncertain bias, respectively.\\nNOS evaluation involves 3 quality parameters: selection, comparability, and exposure assessment. This evaluation method assigns a maximum score of 4 for selection, 2 for comparability, and 3 for exposure.\\nWe computed the pooled relative ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous data, and standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% CI for continuous data. We used the χ2 test for evaluation of homogeneity and the I2 test for evaluation of heterogeneity. We regarded a level of 10% significance (P\\u200a<\\u200a.10) in the χ2 statistic or an I2 >50% as indicating considerable heterogeneity, and used the Mantel-Haenszel random-effect model for these cases. In all other cases, we applied the Mantel–Haenszel fixed-effect model.\\nIf the number of studies with substantial heterogeneity was <10, the t-statistic (Hartung-Knapp-Sidik-Jonkman method) was used instead of the z-test in all random effects analysis to decrease the error rate. We carried out subgroup analysis based on study design if necessary. We also conducted sensitivity analyses to evaluate the influence of a single study on the overall estimate by excluding one study at a time in case of substantial heterogeneity. We calculated the number needed to treat (NNT) based on absolute risk reduction as an estimate of the overall clinical impact of the intervention.\\nPublication bias was assessed using Begg funnel plot and Egger linear regression test. P\\u200a<\\u200a.1 was used to identify the presence of a publication bias, or funnel plots for each data set were visually assessed for asymmetry. If fewer than 10 studies were included, publication bias was not assessed. If data were reported as a median (P25 to P75), median (range), or mean (standard error of mean), we calculated mean and standard deviation from these values. We performed all analyses using Review Manager software (version 5.3, The Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, UK) and Comprehensive meta-analysis software (version 2.0, Biostat, Englewood, NJ).\\nAll synthetic results were based on both peer-reviewed articles and correspondences. As quality assessment was performed only for peer-reviewed articles, the evidence grade was not determined.\\nThe search of OVID-MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and Google Scholar produced 356 studies, and 8 additional studies were identified in manual research. Of the 98 reports identified by searching clinical trial registries, 9 were completed studies. After adjusting for duplicates (n\\u200a=\\u200a8), 365 studies remained. A total of 438 studies were eliminated because they appeared to be outside the scope of interest after reviewing the title and abstracts. In the first stage of study selection, kappa value between 2 reviewers was 0.774. The full texts of the remaining 15 studies were reviewed in more detail. As the study samples overlapped between certain pairs of studies, we selected the one with the most comprehensive population. In the second stage of study selection, kappa value between 2 reviewers was 0.824. Thus, 12 studies comprising a total of 1265 patients were included in the final analysis. These studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis (Fig. 1).\\nThe main characteristics of studies included in this systematic review and meta-analysis are summarized in Table 1. The study included a total of 7 RCTs and 5 cohort studies. Of these, 7 were peer-reviewed articles and 5 were correspondences. Comparator drugs used were lansoprazole, rabeprazole, and esomeprazole. IV-PPI administration was started before ESD in some studies and after ESD in others. All the studies were performed in Japan and the reports were written in English.\\nQuality assessment for peer-reviewed articles was performed using the “risk of bias” tool for RCTs and the NOS for cohort studies. Of the RCTs, one study mentioned the use of random sequence generation and none adequately described allocation concealment. Random sequence generation was adequately described in one study. Allocation concealment, blinding of participants, and blinding of outcome assessors were not performed in any of the studies. All studies were listed in a clinical trial registry (Table 2). Of the cohort studies, almost all the parameters for NOS were adequately described. Methods matched and/or adjusted by factors between exposed and nonexposed were well described in 3 studies. Methods to ascertain outcome via independent blind assessment or record linkage were not described in any of the studies (Table 3).\\nIn all, 5 studies, including 3 RCTs and 2 cohort studies, reported healing rate at 4 weeks after ESD. Of these, 4 studies were peer-reviewed, and 1 was correspondence. Healing rate at 4 weeks post-ESD was significantly higher in the vonoprazan group than in the PPI group (RR 1.20 [1.03–1.40], I2\\u200a=\\u200a46.05, Pχ2\\u200a=\\u200a.103) (Fig. 2). The number needed to treat harm (NNTH) was 14.9, with a 95% CI of 6.6 to ∞. The number needed to treat benefit (NNTB) was 59.4. In subgroup analyses, healing rate at 4 weeks post-ESD was significantly higher in the vonoprazan group than in the PPI group in cohort studies (RR 1.80 (1.11–2.92), I2\\u200a=\\u200a0.0, Pχ2\\u200a=\\u200a.490, NNTH 7.1, 95% CI NNTH 4.0 to NNTH 32.6). However, there was no evidence for significant difference in healing rate in RCTs (RR 1.14 [0.97–1.35], I2\\u200a=\\u200a52.01, Pχ2\\u200a=\\u200a.124, NNTB 131.0 95% CI NNTH 8.9 to ∞ to NNTB 7.8).\\nA total of 4 studies, including 3 RCTs and 1 cohort study, reported healing rates at 4 weeks after ESD. Of these, 3 studies were peer-reviewed and 1 was correspondence. Healing rate at 8 weeks post-ESD was significantly higher in the PPI group than in the vonoprazan group (RR 0.68 [0.48–0.97], I2\\u200a=\\u200a86.59, Pχ2\\u200a<\\u200a.001, NNTB 5.3 95% CI NNTB 3.7 to NNTB 9.6) (Fig. 3). In subgroup analysis, healing rate at 8 weeks post-ESD was significantly higher in the PPI group than in the vonoprazan group in RCT (RR 0.54 [0.29–0.99], I2\\u200a=\\u200a0.0, Pχ2\\u200a=\\u200a0.375, NNTB 9.8 95% CI NNTB 5.1 to NNTB 134.0). When performing sensitivity analysis by excluding 1 study at a time, we found that the significance of results did not change with decreasing heterogeneity.\\nTwo studies, including 1 RCT and 1 cohort study reported shrinkage rate at 4 weeks post-ESD. All the studies were peer-reviewed. There was no evidence of significant difference in shrinkage rate at 4 weeks post-ESD between the groups (RR 1.032 [0.930–1.146], I2\\u200a=\\u200a0.812, Pχ2\\u200a=\\u200a0.315, NNTB 29.6 95% CI NNTH 13.2 to ∞ to NNTB 7.0).\\nThree RCTs reported shrinkage rate at 8 weeks post-ESD. Of these, 2 studies were peer-reviewed and 1 was correspondence. There was no evidence of significant difference in shrinkage rate at 8 weeks post-ESD (RR 1.186 [0.866–1.625], I2\\u200a=\\u200a75.939, Pχ2\\u200a=\\u200a0.016, NNTH 11.7 95% CI NNTH 5.4 to CI NNTB 79.8). Sensitivity analysis, which involved excluding one study at a time, showed no change in significance of the results as the heterogeneity decreased.\\nA total of 11 studies, including 6 RCTs and 5 cohort studies, reported healing rate at 4 weeks post-ESD. Of these, 7 studies were peer-reviewed and 4 studies were correspondence (Fig. 4).\\nThere was no evidence of significant difference in delayed bleeding between groups (RR 0.753 [0.405–1.400], I2\\u200a=\\u200a0.0, Pχ2\\u200a=\\u200a.947, NNTB 44.4 95% CI NNTH 596.0 to ∞ to NNTB 21.4).\\nIn subgroup analysis, there was no evidence of significant differences in both RCTs (RR 0.82 [0.34–2.00], I2\\u200a=\\u200a0.0, Pχ2\\u200a=\\u200a.856, NNTB 74.7 95% CI NNTH 40.6 to ∞ to NNTB 19.5) and cohort studies (RR 0.64 [0.24–1.88], I2\\u200a=\\u200a0.0, Pχ2\\u200a=\\u200a.742, NNTB 32.6 95% CI NNTH 3546.3 to .3I NNTB 16.2).\\nA total of 9 studies, including 5 RCTs and 4 cohort studies, reported ulcer size at 0 weeks after ESD. Of these, 7 studies were peer-reviewed and 2 were correspondence. There was no evidence for significant difference between the 2 groups in ulcer size at 0 weeks post-ESD (standardized mean difference [SMD] 0.2 [−0.1 to 0.5], I2\\u200a=\\u200a77.7, Pχ2\\u200a<\\u200a.001). In subgroup analysis, there was no evidence for significant difference in ulcer size at 0 weeks post-ESD for both RCT and cohort studies (SMD 0.3 [−0.2 to 0.9], I2\\u200a=\\u200a80.2, Pχ2\\u200a<\\u200a.001 and SMD 0.0 (−0.1 to 0.2), I2\\u200a=\\u200a22.1, Pχ2\\u200a=\\u200a.278, respectively).\\nIn total, 4 RCTs reported ulcer size at 4 weeks after ESD. Of these, 2 studies were peer-reviewed, and 2 were correspondence. Ulcer size at 4 weeks post-ESD was significantly higher in the vonoprazan group than in the PPI group (SMD) 0.28 (0.0–0.5), I2\\u200a=\\u200a32.7, Pχ2\\u200a=\\u200a.216).\\nA total of 3 studies, including 2 RCTs and 1 cohort study, reported ulcer size at 8 weeks after ESD. Of these, 2 studies were peer-reviewed and 1 was correspondence. There was no evidence of significant difference between the 2 groups in ulcer size at 8 weeks post-ESD (SMD 0.0 [−0.0 to 0.0] I2\\u200a=\\u200a0.0, Pχ2\\u200a=\\u200a.569). In subgroup analysis for RCT, there was no evidence of significant differences in ulcer size at 4 weeks post-ESD (SMD 0.0 [−0.0 to 0.0] I2\\u200a=\\u200a0.3, Pμ2\\u200a=\\u200a.317).\\nPublication bias was assessed only for delayed bleeding because the number of studies included was <10 in the assessment of other outcomes. No evidence of publication bias was detected by either Egger regression test (P\\u200a=\\u200a.786) or funnel plot (Fig. 5).\\nWe conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of RCT and cohort studies, directly comparing vonoprazan and PPIs in terms of their effects on artificial ulcer healing and post-ESD bleeding. Our findings can be summarized as 3 main results. First, vonoprazan enhanced the healing rate of artificial ulcers to a greater extent than PPIs until 4 weeks after ESD, but PPIs had enhanced the healing rate to a greater extent than vonoprazan at 8 weeks post-ESD. Second, no significant differences in ulcer shrinkage rates between PPI-treated groups and vonoprazan-treated groups were observed at 8 weeks post-ESD. Lastly, no significant differences in post-ESD bleeding were observed between vonoprazan-treated groups and PPI-treated groups.\\nTo accelerate ulcer healing, clot stabilization through elevation of intragastric pH is required. Inhibition of gastric acid production may contribute toward a neutral pH, which can stabilize blood clots and prevent recurrent bleeding, as blood coagulation and platelet aggregation are pH-dependent. In particular, the healing speed of ESD-induced ulcers is greater than that of peptic ulcers as a result of differences in their histology. The proper muscle layer under peptic ulcers is partially replaced by fibrosis resulting from chronic inflammation. However, the proper muscle layer under the endoscopic resection area is not damaged, so marginal blood flow can facilitate healing of artificial ulcers. This healing process must function effectively to minimize the occurrence of post-ESD complications. Despite these differences, artificial ulcers induced by gastric ESD are typically treated with PPI for 4 to 8 weeks, just as in case of peptic ulcers.\\nVonoprazan, a novel and orally active P-CAB, is considered a potential alternative to PPIs in the treatment of acid-related diseases such as reflux esophagitis and gastroduodenal ulcers as well as in the eradication of H pylori. It has gained popularity owing to its superior characteristics compared to conventional PPIs, such as rapid onset of action, longer duration of action, and consistent acid suppression. Moreover, it is not affected by acid secretion state, mealtimes, or CYP2C19 polymorphism.\\nMost studies found that vonoprazan was superior to PPIs in promoting healing or preventing delayed bleeding. However, we observed no significant difference between the 2 drugs in terms of rate of induced ulcer shrinkage or delayed bleeding, which may be a result of the differences in study design and characteristics. Our study showed that ulcer healing rates for the first 4 weeks were superior in patients taking vonoprazan compared with those taking PPIs, although shrinkage rates were not significantly different. This might be because vonoprazan acts faster than PPIs in ensuring that the optimal gastric pH is achieved. Previous studies demonstrated that PPIs showed a delay in the sustained reduction of acid, whereas vonoprazan was reported to achieve steady-state acid levels as early as 1 day after ESD.\\nThis study compared the efficacy of vonoprazan in healing post-ESD artificial ulcers with PPIs based on studies that investigated different PPIs and used different durations of administration. As a result, it showed that the healing rate of vonoprazan was superior to that of PPI at 4 weeks post-ESD. On the contrary, the healing rate of PPI was superior to that of vonoprazan at 8 weeks post-ESD. However, there was no significant difference in the ulcer shrinkage rate at 4 or 8 weeks after ESD between the vonoprazan group and the PPI group. In most studies, PPI was administered intravenously during 2 days post-ESD, which may be associated with an increase in gastric pH and partly contribute to the observed rapidity in the healing process. However, in early healing of post-ESD ulcers, vonoprazan was more beneficial than PPI.\\nIn our study, although healing rate at 4 weeks post-ESD was significantly higher in the vonoprazan than in the PPI group in cohort studies, the healing rate exhibited by the former group did not reach clinical significance, which may be a result of lower power from a small number of patients and a small number of available studies. Thus, additional well-designed, large studies may clarify the issues presented here.\\nOur secondary aim was the evaluation of the preventive effect of vonoprazan on delayed bleeding compared to PPIs. Clinically, the prevention of delayed bleeding is crucial after ESD. The frequency of delayed bleeding after ESD has been reported to be approximately 5%, and most delayed bleeding events develop within the first 2 weeks after ESD. Therefore, vonoprazan is excellent at preventing delayed bleeding in theory, owing to its persistent, fast, and highly potent suppression of acid production. In fact, there was no significant difference in the incidence of delayed bleeding after ESD between the vonoprazan and PPI groups. There may be 2 reasons for this result. First, acid suppression by both vonoprazan and PPIs was potent enough to prevent delayed bleeding. Second, meticulous coagulation in thick blood vessels with potential bleeding afterward was performed during ESD procedure or second look endoscopy.\\nThe present systematic review and meta-analysis has several limitations. First, large heterogeneity was observed between included studies for some variables. The outcomes of healing rate and shrinkage rate at 8 weeks after ESD and ulcer size at 0 weeks after ESD showed substantial heterogeneity. This may have resulted from differences in the type of study, the different kinds of PPIs investigated, and diverse dosage regimens for PPI administration. In response to this limitation, we tried to conduct the subgroup analysis for study design. In addition, we conducted sensitivity analyses to evaluate the influence of a single study on the overall estimate by excluding one study at a time.\\nSecondly, some of the evidence available is from retrospective cohort studies. As random sequence generation and allocation concealment were not performed in cohort studies, their inclusion could have led to selection bias. However, cohort studies included in this meta-analysis adequately described the selection parameters. Thus, we assumed that our analysis may not be influenced by selection bias.\\nLastly, all the trials included in this analysis were from Japan, without any appropriate published data from Western countries. Thus, the results may not be generalizable to other races.\\nNevertheless, our study has demonstrated strength through the application of rigorous methodologies to provide the first systematic review investigating the effects of vonoprazan and PPI in the treatment of ESD-induced artificial ulcers and prevention of delayed bleeding.\\nBased on current data, there seemed to be no substantial difference in the ulcer healing rate and frequency of post-ESD bleeding between the vonoprazan-treated and PPI-treated groups. However, our data conclusively demonstrated that the efficacy of vonoprazan was superior to that of PPI for post-ESD ulcer healing in the early phase of the healing process. In this study, vonoprazan and PPI exhibited equal effectiveness in diminishing the incidence of post-ESD bleeding, suggesting that conventional PPIs administered by initial intravenous infusion might affect the prevention of postoperative bleeding following gastric ESD.\\nIn conclusion, in the present study, vonoprazan more rapidly and effectively treated artificial ulcers after ESD than did PPIs. Further studies with larger numbers of patients are warranted to clarify the efficacy of vonoprazan compared with PPI.\\nThe guarantor for this article is Beom Jin Kim, M.D., Ph.D.\\nBeom Jin Kim conceived and designed the study.

       "    'fulltext': 'Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is a commonly used method for the treatment of gastrointestinal adenoma, precancerous lesions, or early-stage cancer without metastases, due to its clinical effectiveness and comparative safety. However, sometimes a large area of dissection results in post-ESD ulcers which can result in severe complications, including delayed bleeding and perforation, especially in the upper gastrointestinal tract, because of the effects of gastric acid on the ulcerated mucosa. The incidence of delayed bleeding from ruptured vessels and perforation following ESD has been reported to be approximately 3.5%. Therefore, reducing gastric acid secretion following ESD of the upper gastrointestinal tract is required, and treatment with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have been commonly used. Uedo et al. conducted a randomized controlled trial (RCT) that showed that PPI treatment was more effective than the use of histamine H2-receptor antagonists in the prevention of bleeding from ulcers following ESD. Also, prophylactic coagulation of visible vessels is now recommended by many clinicians to prevent post-ESD bleeding.\\nVonoprazan (Takecab®) (Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) is a new oral potassium-competitive acid blocker (P-CAB), which received first approval in 2015 in Japan. Vonoprazan competitively blocks the potassium-binding site of H+/K+-ATPase and the inhibitory action on gastric acid secretion of this novel drug is more stable than that of PPIs due to its higher pKa value. In preclinical research studies, vonoprazan has been shown to accumulate at high concentrations in cells of gastric glands and is slowly cleared, resulting in a more sustained and greater increase in gastric PH.\\nGiven its strong inhibitory effect on gastric acid production, vonoprazan has been shown to be effective in the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), peptic ulcers, and other gastric acid-related disorders. Some recent comparative studies on the treatment of peptic ulcers following ESD have shown that vonoprazan had a stronger acid-inhibiting effect than PPIs. However, these findings were not supported by two recent phase 3 RCTs. There remains controversy regarding whether the use of vonoprazan is more effective than PPIs when used to heal iatrogenic peptic ulcers after ESD.\\nTherefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to compare the efficacy, safety, and tolerance of vonoprazan with PPIs in the treatment of peptic ulcers resulting from ESD.\\nThe systematic review of the literature and the meta-analysis were performed up to March 2018. Relevant publications were selected that compared vonoprazan with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) for the treatment of ulcers resulting from endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD). The following databases were searched: Web of Knowledge, PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. The following search terms were used: ‘vonoprazan’ or ‘Takecab’ or ‘potassium-competitive’ or ‘acid blocker’ or ‘P-CAB,’ and ‘proton pump inhibitor’ or ‘PPI’ or ‘PPIs,’ and ‘endoscopic submucosal dissection’ or ‘ESD’ or ‘artificial ulcers’ or ‘post-ESD.’ Also, all published studies in all forms of publication were identified, irrespective of outcomes, country, and language. The systematic review and meta-analysis were performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement.\\nIrrelevant studies were initially excluded based on the content of their titles and abstracts. Potentially relevant published studies underwent a review of the entire published manuscript. The selection criteria for inclusion in the meta-analysis included: patients who has been diagnosed by upper gastrointestinal endoscopy; patients who underwent ESD for endoscopic mucosal lesions, adenoma, or early-stage gastric cancer; randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the efficacy of vonoprazan 20 mg/day with standard-dose PPIs in the treatment of post-ESD peptic ulcers; patients who did not receive other medical treatments before the trials; study periods of at least 4 weeks; endoscopic assessment of the healing of the ulcers at 4 weeks or 8 weeks following ESD. There were no limitations on patient nationality or ethnicity. The decision to include or exclude the published studies was made separately by two researchers, and any differences in opinion were settled by consensus with the inclusion of a third study researcher.\\nTwo reviewers independently extracted the following information, which was collected using an Excel spreadsheet: first author; year of publication; publication type; country of the study; publication language; therapeutic strategy; post-ESD follow-up period; clinical outcomes, including healing rate, shrinkage rate, and rate of adverse events. In this meta-analysis, the primary outcome measure was the comparison of the healing rates of post-ESD peptic ulcers between vonoprazan-based therapy and PPI-based therapy. The secondary outcome safety and tolerance events included delayed bleeding, perforation, and hepatic injury.\\nQuality assessment and risk of bias in the identified RCTs was performed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool. Two investigators individually assessed the methodological quality of each RCT.\\nStatistical analysis of data was performed using Review Manager (RevMan) version 5.3. Multiple comparisons were performed, and for each comparison, a 95% confidence interval (CI) of the pooled risk ratios (RRs) were calculated to analyze the variables. The Mantel-Haenszel method, or fixed-effects model, was used. However, when there was clear study heterogeneity, a random-effects model was chosen. Two methods were used to investigate study heterogeneity, the Cochrane’s Q test considered the study to be heterogeneous if the P-value was <0.1, and I2 statistics values ≥25%, ≥50%, and ≥75% indicated mild, moderate, and substantial study heterogeneity, respectively. All P-values were two-tailed, and the level of statistical significance was 0.05 in all tests. A funnel plot was performed to assess publication bias.\\nThe literature search strategy initially identified 46 potentially relevant published studies, from which seven eligible published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were selected, which included data from 548 patients (Figure 1). The seven identified studies compared vonoprazan with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) for the treatment of ulcers resulting from endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD), which fulfilled the inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis. Five of the studies were published as full-text manuscripts, and the other two were meeting abstracts. Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of these seven studies, all of which were published in the English language between 2016 and 2018, which included patients who were recruited to studies between 2015 to 2017 in Japan. Table 2 summarizes the outcomes of these seven trials. The results of the quality assessment of the meta-analysis data are presented in Figure 2.\\nAn analysis was performed of the studies that provided 4-week or 8-week healing rates of post-ESD ulcers. As shown in Figure 3A and 3B, there was no difference between the healing rates of the vonoprazan-based therapy and PPI-based therapy. The pooled relative risk (RR) of healing rate was 0.64 (95% CI, 0.33–1.22) for the 4-week study group, and 0.98 (95% CI, 0.84–1.15) for the 8-week study group. Moderate heterogeneity was identified in the 8-week group using Cochrane’s Q test (df=4; P=0.04; I2=60%).\\nIn these five trials published as full texts, three used lansoprazole as control, and the other two used esomeprazole. To identify the reasons for the difference between relevant trials in the 8-week group, a subgroup analysis was performed for these studies. The random-effects model showed that the relative efficacy of the healing rates was different for the esomeprazole-treated group and the RR was 1.14 (95% CI, 0.99–1.32) and in the lansoprazole-treated group, the RR was 0.88 (95% CI, 0.72–1.06). Heterogeneity testing using Cochrane’s Q test showed subgroup differences (df=1; P=0.03; I2=79.0%). The I2 value of the lansoprazole-treated group decreased from 60% to 38%, and the I2 value of the esomeprazole-treated group decreased to 7%.\\nIn the seven published RCTs, all of them provided information of delayed bleeding rate, but only two articles included the perforation rate and one article described the hepatic injury. As shown in Figure 4, the fixed-effects model showed no significant difference in adverse event rates between the vonoprazan-based therapy and PPI-based therapy. The pooled RR was 0.65 (95% CI, 0.31–1.38) and there is no significant heterogeneity among these studies, as determined by Cochrane’s Q test (df=4; P=0.77; I2=0%).\\nThe funnel plot for the rate of adverse events showed some asymmetry, indicating the occurrence of publication bias (Figure 5). Accordingly, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to evaluate the reliability of this meta-analysis. In five trials, the duration of therapy was 8 weeks, and the duration of the remaining two trials was 4 weeks. A sensitivity analysis was undertaken that included the 8-week treatment trials, which did not show significant differences (Table 3). A further sensitivity analysis was performed that only included trials using lansoprazole treatment, and the sensitivity analysis did not show any significant differences (Table 3).\\nProton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are commonly used in the management of conditions associated with increased acid production and ulceration of the upper gastrointestinal tract, including gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), Barrett’s esophagus, and Helicobacter pylori-associated peptic ulcer. Since the development of first-generation PPIs, similar drugs have been developed and shown to be effective. The long-term use of PPIs can be associated with adverse effects including bone fracture, myocardial infarction, and infections, although the risk of these complications is quite low. Although changing the type of PPI or adding other medications have been proposed, there is currently a lack of evidence to provide the basis for guidelines for combination therapy.\\nVonoprazan (Takecab®) (Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) is a new potassium-competitive acid blocker (P-CAB) and is a novel treatment for peptic ulcer disease that inhibits gastric acid production that first received approval in Japan in 2015. Therefore, the majority of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on vonoprazan have been conducted in Japanese hospitals or research centers. Clinically, the safety and efficacy of vonoprazan remain to be established. Therefore, this study aimed to compare the effects of vonoprazan and PPIs for the treatment of ulcers resulting from endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) by performing a systematic review and meta-analysis.\\nIn this meta-analysis, pooled data were analyzed from seven published studies that included 548 patients. The results of this meta-analysis showed no apparent difference between 20 mg/day of vonoprazan and standard doses of PPIs in term of treating post-ESD peptic ulcers. The healing rate of PPI-based therapy had a marginally, but not significantly improved efficacy when compared with vonoprazan-based therapy. In term of safety, the meta-analysis showed that adverse effects, including delayed bleeding and perforation, showed fewer adverse effects in the vonoprazan-treated group, which did not reach statistical significance. These findings not only add to current evidence obtained from clinical trials but also call for more high-quality controlled clinical studies.\\nThis meta-analysis study had several limitations. Two clinical trials were published in abstract form only, which might have resulted in the acquisition of limited data for meta-analysis. Also, vonoprazan was first approved for clinical use in Japan, and the majority of published clinical trials were undertaken in Japan, and the results of further trials are still needed from multiple countries. The observation periods of the enrolled studies were limited, and so chronic adverse events, such as bone fracture, myocardial infarction, and infection, could not be evaluated. In view of the moderate heterogeneity identified by meta-analysis on the healing rate (Figure 3A), it appeared that combining lansoprazole and esomeprazole with vonoprazon had a different outcome and so further meta-analysis is needed to compare lansoprazole and esomeprazole with vonoprazon separately.\\nSystematic review and meta-analysis compared the efficacy, safety, and tolerance of vonoprazan with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) in the treatment of ulcers resulting from endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD). The efficacy of vonoprazan was found to be comparable with PPIs for treatment of post-ESD peptic ulcers. However, this meta-analysis has also shown that further global, multi-center, large-scale controlled clinical trials are needed to provide sufficient evidence to determine whether vonoprazan can be recommended as a new treatment option for peptic ulcers resulting from ESD.'},\n",

       "    'fulltext': \"This systematic review and meta-analysis will provide a comprehensive and objective comparison of the effect of vonoprazan and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) in gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in randomized controlled trials\\nThe study will provide useful and novel information for patients, healthcare providers, and policymakers.\\nThe study will assess the methodological and reporting qualities of included studies using modified risk of bias tool.\\nOur results may be limited by heterogeneity due to differences in type of study, the different kinds of PPIs investigated, and diverse dosage regimens of PPI administration.\\nStrengths and limitations\\nGastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a troublesome condition that causes symptoms such as heartburn and acid regurgitation by reflux of stomach contents. GERD is prevalent in Western countries, and recently it has been dramatically increasing in many Asian countries. GERD includes erosive esophagitis (EE) and non-erosive reflux disease (NERD) diagnosed by esophagogastroduodenoscopy, but the severity of symptoms is not necessarily proportional to the degree of mucosal injury.\\nGenerally, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have been the mainstay for the management of GERD. Indeed, PPIs have been beneficial in patients with both EE and NERD, and patients with EE showed 20% greater improvement of GERD symptoms than patients with NERD. Although PPIs are widely used in clinical practice, the standard dose of PPI does not always induce sufficient gastric acid suppression in all patients because of their pharmacological limitations. In fact, 10% to 20% of patients with severe EE (Los Angeles classification C and D) do not heal despite 8 weeks of continuous double-dose PPI therapy. Moreover, it has been well documented that achieving complete symptomatic relief with PPI is more difficult than simply healing mucosal breaks, resulting in dissatisfaction of current therapy in about one-third of patients with GERD.\\nRecently, a novel potassium-competitive acid blocking (P-CAB) agent called vonoprazan (TAKECAB; Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), has been developed that is stronger, faster, and exhibits longer-lasting acid suppression than conventional PPIs. The acid-inhibitory effect of vonoprazan has been reported to be more potent than that of PPIs, with greater impact against acid-related diseases such as GERD, Helicobacter pylori infection, gastric and duodenal ulcers, and prevention of recurrence in nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory-drug or low-dose-aspirin ulcer.\\nVonoprazan may have an efficacy comparable to or better than that of PPIs in the treatment of GERD. There is a growing number of reports comparing the effectiveness of vonoprazan with that of PPIs in treating GERD. However, the findings have been variable and reported outcomes are conflicting. Furthermore, no previous systematic review and meta-analysis have been published regarding this issue. Therefore, we developed the protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess and compare the effects of vonoprazan and PPIs in the treatment of GERD in randomized clinical trials (RCT).\\nWe developed the protocol for our systematic review and meta-analysis according to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis protocols (PRISMA-P) statement, and registered it in the international prospective register of systematic reviews PROSPERO network (registration number: CRD42018091655; www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO).\\nThis systematic review and meta-analysis comparing the effects of vonoprazan and PPIs for the management of GERD will be performed in accordance with the protocol recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration and will be reported according to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines.\\nThis systematic review does not require ethical approval or informed consent because there will be no direct contact with individual patients, and only previously published data will be included in the review.\\nOnly randomized controlled studies (parallel design and cross-over design) will be eligible for inclusion. Studies in any language published until September 2018 will be included. Cohort studies, review articles, case-control studies, case reports, case series, letters to the editor, commentaries, proceedings, laboratory science studies, and any other non-relevant studies will be excluded from analysis.\\nInclusion criteria for study populations will be all patients with GERD, including EE and NERD. No restrictions will be applied in terms of age, sex or ethnicity.\\nInterventions to be examined will include medication with potassium-competitive acid blocker including vonoprazan and comparator will be medication with PPIs including lansoprazole, esomeprazole, rabeprazole, etc.\\nThe primary outcomes are symptoms and improvement rate of esophageal erosion in the intention-to-treat analysis (O), and the secondary outcomes are symptoms and improvement rate of esophageal erosion in the per-protocol analysis, the comparative efficacy in terms of healing rate of esophageal erosion on endoscopy, the comparative efficacy in terms of improvement of esophageal impedance-pH study, adverse events, long-term safety and the comparative efficacy in terms of CYP2C19 metabolite levels.\\nA search will be performed in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and Google Scholar, for studies published up to September 2018. We will also search registered trials described in clinical trial registries, which are listed in the Appendix.\\nThe search terms included vonoprazan, Takecab, P-CAB, TAK-438, potassium-competitive, GERD, EE, NERD and GERD.\\nTwo authors will screen titles and abstracts of the retrieved articles. Reference lists will be imported to Endnote 8.1 (Thompson Reuters, CA), and duplicate articles will be removed. Additional relevant articles will be identified by scanning reference lists of articles obtained from the original search.\\nThe titles and abstracts identified through the search strategy described above will be scanned independently by 2 authors. To minimize data duplication as a result of multiple reporting, papers from the same author and organ will be compared. For reports determined to be eligible based on the title or abstract, the full paper will be retrieved. Potentially relevant studies chosen by at least 1 author will be retrieved and evaluated in full-text versions. Articles meeting the inclusion criteria will be assessed separately by 2 authors, and any discrepancies will be resolved through discussion. In cases where agreement cannot be reached, the dispute will be resolved with the help of a third investigator. A flow diagram for the search and selection process will be developed following PRISMA guidelines.\\nUsing a standardized extraction form, the following data will be extracted independently by 2 authors: study name (along with the name of the first author and year of publication), country where the study was conducted, study design, country, study period, publication language, number of patients, types and doses of intervention and comparator medication, symptom and esophageal erosion improvement rate, healing rate of esophageal erosion on endoscopy, improvement of esophageal impedance-pH study, adverse events, long-term safety and CYP2C19 metabolite levels.\\nIf information is missing, an attempt will be made to contact the study authors to obtain the relevant information. When unsuccessful, missing information will be calculated if possible from the relevant data within the study.\\nThe reference list will be divided into 2 halves. Two authors will complete data extraction, 1 for each half of the reference list. Data extraction forms will be cross-checked to verify accuracy and consistency of the extracted data.\\nThe quality of the studies will be independently assessed by 2 authors using the “risk of bias” tool for RCTs according to the Review Manager (version 5.3, The Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, UK). Quality will be evaluated using the following potential sources of bias: sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants, procedure performer (anesthesiologist and intervention implementer), outcome assessor, incomplete data, and selective reporting. The methodology for each study was graded as “high”, “low,”, or “unclear”, which reflected a high risk of bias, low risk of bias, and uncertain bias, respectively.\\nAd-hoc tables will be designed to summarize data from the included studies and show their key characteristics and any important questions related to the aim of this review. After data have been extracted, reviewers will determine whether a meta-analysis is possible.\\nWe will compute the pooled relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous data, and standardized mean difference (SMD) or mean difference (MD) with 95% CI for continuous data.\\nBetween-study heterogeneity will be assessed using the Cochran Q and Higgins I2 statistics. A P value of <.10 for the Chi2 statistic or an I2 greater than 50% will be considered as showing considerable heterogeneity, and data will be analyzed using the Mantel–Haenszel random-effect model. Otherwise, we will apply the Mantel–Haenszel fixed-effect model.\\nIf the number of studies with substantial heterogeneity is less than 10, the t statistic (Hartung-Knapp-Sidik-Jonkman method) will be used instead of the Z test in all random effects analysis to decrease the error rate. We will conduct sensitivity analyses to evaluate the influence of a single study on the overall estimate by excluding 1 study at a time in case of substantial heterogeneity. We will calculate the number needed to treat based on absolute risk reduction as an estimate of the overall clinical impact of the intervention.\\nPublication bias will be assessed by using Begg funnel plot and Egger test. Begg funnel plots are scattered plots of the log ORs of individual studies on the x-axis against 1/standard error (SE) of each study on the y-axis. Egger test is a test for linear regression of the normalized effect estimate (log OR/SE) against its precision (1/SE). An asymmetrical funnel plot or a P value of < .1 from Egger's test will be considered to indicate the presence of publication bias. If publication bias is detected, trim and fill analyses will be performed. If fewer than 10 studies are included, publication bias will not be assessed. If data are reported as a median (P25 –P75), median (range) or mean (SE of mean), we will calculate the mean and standard deviation from these values. We will perform all analyses using Review Manager software (version 5.3, The Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, UK) and Stata SE version 15.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX).\\nThe evidence grade will be determined using the guidelines of the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system which uses sequential assessment of the evidence quality that is followed by an assessment of the risk-benefit balance and a subsequent judgment on the strength of the recommendations.\\nGERD is a disease comprising symptoms and complications related to the reflux of gastric contents into the esophagus. Although PPIs are used as a first-line treatment of GERD, epidemiologic estimates show that approximately 20% to 40% of patients with GERD are poor responders to PPI therapy. Furthermore, conventional PPIs cannot satisfy the expected therapeutic effect in terms of acid suppression.\\nAs a novel acid suppressant, the effect of vonoprazan on the treatment of GERD has been evaluated. Various clinical studies have reported that vonoprazan is comparable or superior to PPIs for the treatment of GERD including EE and NERD. However, it remains unclear whether vonoprazan is superior to PPIs for the treatment of GERD. Therefore, a meta-analysis and systematic review in this field may lead a more accurate conclusion.\\nWe designed this systematic review and meta-analysis for the purpose of comparing efficacy of vonoprazan with PPIs for the management of GERD. This study will merge all the current evidence and provide suggestions for clinical practice. To the best of our knowledge, this study will provide the first evidence that vonoprazan may be considered an effective treatment for GERD. Meanwhile, the result of this meta-analysis will add knowledge in the comparative effectiveness of current pharmacological treatment, which helps clinicians make the best decisions on their first-choice drug for GERD.\\nConceptualization: Beom Jin Kim.\\nData curation: Geunjoo Choi.\\nFormal analysis: Hyun Kang, Beom Jin Kim.\\nFunding acquisition: Hyun Kang.\\nInvestigation: Hyun Kang, Geunjoo Choi.\\nMethodology: Beom Jin Kim.\\nProject administration: Beom Jin Kim.\\nSoftware: Hyun Kang.\\nSupervision: Beom Jin Kim, Jae Gyu Kim.\\nWriting – original draft: Hyun Kang.\\nWriting – review & editing: Beom Jin Kim, Jae Gyu Kim.\\nBeom Jin Kim orcid: 0000-0002-0938-6697\"},\n",

       "    'fulltext': 'Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have often been used for acid-related diseases including gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), gastric and duodenal ulcers, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-associated ulcers, and Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy. Conventional PPIs with a benzimidazole structure irreversibly inhibit hydrogen potassium (H+, K+)-ATPases, which produce acid in gastric parietal cells and more strongly block acid secretion compared to histamine H2 receptor antagonists. Although PPIs have been used for more than a quarter-century as a first-line treatment for these diseases, it has become clear that there are some issues in need of improvement (Table 1). First, it takes several days to show maximal effect. Reflux symptoms of GERD are not sufficiently relieved after the first dose of PPIs in two-thirds of patients because of its slow onset of the action, and one-half of patients still have symptoms even after 3 days of treatment. Second, the effects of PPIs are influenced by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19 polymorphism. Third, its effects at night are not satisfactory. Finally, although it requires an acidic environment for activation, PPIs are unstable in acidic conditions, so enteric coating is needed.\\nTo overcome the aforementioned unmet needs, alternative formulations of conventional PPIs and new H+, K+-ATPase inhibitors have been established. With these efforts, vonoprazan (TAK-438), a potassium-competitive acid blocker (P-CAB), was developed. It was found to have satisfactory effects and a good safety profile in clinical studies of gastric and duodenal ulcers, reflux esophagitis, NSAID-associated ulcers, and H. pylori eradication. Vonoprazan (Takecab) was released to the market in Japan in February 2015. In this review, we summarize the effects of P-CABs, mainly using vonoprazan data.\\nImmediate-release omeprazole and dexlansoprazole modified release (MR), which improve nocturnal acid breakthrough (NAB), have been introduced as alternative formulations of PPIs in some countries. Dexlansoprazole MR is the R-enantiomer of lansoprazole and is a PPI with dual delayed-release formulation. The dual release system in the duodenum and small intestine achieved 2 peak concentrations within 2 hours and 5 hours after administration. Percentage time 24-hour intragastric pH above 4 of dexlansoprazole MR 60 mg and lansoprazole 30 mg once daily for 5 days administration was 71% and 60%, respectively (P < 0.01). However, these drugs only have small advantages for the control of acid secretion compared to conventional PPIs.\\nP-CABs were first developed in the 1980s, and have been studied by many pharmaceutical companies worldwide, as they rapidly, effectively, and reversibly inhibit the proton pump (H+,K+-ATPase α subunit). However, P-CABs such as the imidazopyridine compound SCH28080 from Schering-Plough Corporation have an imidazopyridine ring that correlated with hepatic toxicity in human clinical studies and did not show superior effects compared to conventional PPIs. Imidazopyridine derivatives including AR-H047108, and linaprazan (AZD0865), imidazonaphthyridine derivatives including soraprazan, pyrimidine derivatives including revaprazan (YH1885), and pyrrole derivatives including vonoprazan (TAK-438) (Fig. 1) were also developed. However, only revaprazan and vonoprazan are currently on the market (Table 2). A concentration of up to 75 mg linaprazan provided similar efficacy to 40 mg esomeprazole for the healing of reflux esophagitis and controlling of heartburn. However, linaprazan did not provide more clinical benefits than 20 mg esomeprazole for the management of GERD. Because linaprazan had similar effects to esomeprazole but caused hepatic toxicity, its development was discontinued. Revaprazan is only available in South Korea and India, and is used for the treatment of peptic ulcers but not for GERD. Revaprazan rapidly inhibits gastric acid secretion but intragastric pH could only be increased to a maximum of 5 at the dosage used. The P-CAB YH4808 was developed in Korea; dosage ≥ 200 mg produces a rapid, sustained suppression of gastric secretion with good tolerability. The twice-daily use of YH4808 is more effective, especially at night, than the same dose used once-daily. However, this compound is still not available clinically. Other agents, DWP14012, and 1-(5-(1H-indol-5-yl)-1-(pyridin-3-ylsulfonyl)-1H-pyrrol-3-yl)-N-methylmethanamine (KFP-H008), P-CABs, are under development. Tegoprazan is another potent P-CAB that was successfully tested in a phase III trial in Korea and will be released to the market in 2018 (Table 2). A compound that has a pyrrole derivative in the center was found through high-throughput screening. After modifying the compound to reduce hepatic toxicity and influence of CYP2C19 polymorphism, vonoprazan was developed.\\nVonoprazan is a novel, orally active P-CAB that binds and inhibits H+, K+-ATPase at the final step in the acid secretory pathway in gastric parietal cells, and it has different mechanisms of action than conventional PPIs. It can inhibit the proton pump, even in neutral environments with an inhibitory constant (Ki) of 10 nM at pH 7 and of 3 nM at pH 6.5. It has stronger potential to inhibit the gastric proton pump than another P-CAB, SCH28080, and lansoprazole. The half-maximal inhibitory concentrations of vonoprazan, SCH28080, and lansoprazole were 0.018 nM, 0.14 nM, and 7.6 μM, respectively. The half-life (T1/2) of vonoprazan dissociation by potassium chloride was 12.5 hours in isolated proton pumps, and that of SCH28080 was less than 2 minutes. Therefore, vonoprazan has high affinity and slow clearance from gastric parietal cells, accumulating in both resting and stimulated conditions. The acid dissociation constant of vonoprazan is 9.37, which is higher than that of conventional PPIs and other P-CABs.\\nWhen vonoprazan is exposed to acidic conditions, it is instantly protonated and remains stable. It can accumulate, function, and bind the proton pump of gastric parietal cells in strongly acidic secretory canaliculi. Vonoprazan binds −10 Å from the ion binding site that is close to the middle of the membrane domain of H+, K+-ATPase. Hydrogen bonding between Tyr799 and the sulfone of vonoprazan was suggested. The dissociation rate of vonoprazan from H+, K+-ATPase is slow and acid does not decomposed it. Non-ionic type of vonoprazan is decreased in a strong acidic secretory canaliculi and passive transport from the acidic secretory canaliculus to the cytoplasm is inhibited. It is therefore retained for a long time inside the parietal cells and can inhibit H+, K+-ATPase that is activated by further stimulation of acid secretion (Fig. 2). The concentration of vonoprazan is up to 108-fold higher in the secretory canaliculus of the parietal cell than in the plasma. It can stay in the protonated form, and binds to the H+, K+-ATPase α subunit to compete with potassium binding, and inhibits the function of the pump. The binding of vonoprazan to the proton pump is ionic, and its effects are reversible and dose-dependent.\\nConventional PPI is a form of prodrug, which must be protonated to become an active form. To achieve this protonation process, the PPI should be reached in parietal cells in which acid secretion must be activated after the meal. Considering the time taken for this process, 30 minutes before the meal is required. However, vonoprazan can be taken regardless of meal ingestion and the rate of absorption is not affected by meals. The absorption speed of vonoprazan is rapid, and the time taken to reach maximum concentration in plasma is less than 2 hours after oral administration. After absorption, the T1/2 in plasma is approximately 2 hours for conventional PPIs, but up to 9 hours for vonoprazan. Therefore, vonoprazan stays in the blood longer and can block acid secretion continuously. The pharmacokinetics of vonoprazan are similar in Japanese and non-Japanese subjects.\\nThe CYP2C19 polymorphism influences the pharmacokinetics of conventional PPIs and affects interindividual variability in pharmacodynamics. However, because vonoprazan is not primarily metabolized by CYP2C19, the data from clinical studies on healthy volunteers and GERD patients showed limited influence by CYP2C19 polymorphisms. Furthermore, the effects of clarithromycin, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, on the pharmacokinetics of vonoprazan were evaluated and no significant pharmacokinetic interactions were observed.\\nVonoprazan is effectively absorbed and quickly accumulates in parietal cells. In contrast, conventional PPIs require 3 to 5 days to achieve maximal and steady-state inhibition of acid secretion. The effect is more pronounced after the first dose of vonoprazan compared to conventional PPIs; a single dose of 20 mg vonoprazan can increase intragastric pH to nearly 7 in as little as 4 hours. This rapid onset of action is appropriate for the treatment of breakthrough GERD symptoms and for on-demand therapy. Furthermore, % time 24-hour intragastric pH above 4 of vonoprazan 20 mg once daily for 4 days and 7 days was 82.9% and 85.2%, respectively and the effect continues without intragastric pH dipping below 4. The means of night-time pH above 4 after administration of vonoprazan 20 mg on day 1 were higher than after administration of esomeprazole 20 mg or rabeprazole 10 mg (Table 1). Once this pH is maintained through daily administration, the pepsin produced by chief cells cannot be activated. Therefore, vonoprazan is a strong acid blocker that has rapid, stable, and long-lasting effects and these effects were stronger than conventional PPIs and prototype P-CAB. Phase I studies of single ascending and multiple repeat doses in Japan and the United Kingdom revealed that vonoprazan was well-tolerated at single doses of 1–120 mg and at repeat doses of 10–40 mg. The mean percentage of time that patients had a intragastric pH above 4 after multiple doses of 40 mg vonoprazan was 85.3% and 100.0% during the day and 86.5% and 100.0% at night (21:00–9:00) on days 1 and 7, respectively.\\nH. pylori infection can be eradicated by elevating intragastric pH using an acid suppressant in combination with at least 2 antibiotics. H. pylori enters the growth phase from a stationary phase at intragastric pH above 5, at which point it becomes susceptible to antibiotics. Although conventional PPIs have been used to suppress gastric acid secretion, recent H. pylori eradication rates have decreased due to increases in antibiotic-resistant H. pylori strains. Increasing the dosage of PPIs and changing antibiotics have been attempted to increase the eradication rate. In addition, the development of P-CABs that can strongly suppress acid secretion has been an attractive option for increasing the eradication rate. A randomized, double-blind study was conducted to prove the non-inferiority of 20 mg vonoprazan compared to 30 mg lansoprazole for the first-line triple therapy for H. pylori eradication with 750 mg amoxicillin and 200 mg or 400 mg clarithromycin. Patients who did not achieve eradication also received second-line vonoprazan-based triple therapy with 750 mg amoxicillin and 250 mg metronidazole. All drugs were administered orally twice daily for 7 days. The eradication rate with vonoprazan was 92.6% compared to 75.9% with lansoprazole. Both first-line and second-line therapies were satisfactory and non-inferiority was proven. A recent meta-analysis also showed the superiority of vonoprazan-based triple therapy compared to conventional PPI-based triple therapy. Therefore, vonoprazan-based triple therapy should be the first-line treatment for H. pylori eradication (Table 1).\\nBoth prospective and retrospective studies have shown that the H. pylori eradication rate with vonoprazan-based triple therapy for clarithromycin-resistant subgroup was significantly higher than that with PPI-based triple therapy. Two prospective randomized controlled studies showed no difference in the eradication rate between vonoprazan-based and PPI-based triple therapies in clarithromycin-sensitive subgroup (Fig. 3). However, two retrospective studies indicated a superior eradication rate with vonoprazan-based triple therapy. These data indicate that the increased eradication rate with vonoprazan-based therapy is mainly gained in clarithromycin-resistant patients; thus, vonoprazan-based therapy must be effective for the clarithromycin-resistant H. pylori eradication, though sensitivity assay of clarithromycin of H. pylori is not recommended and is not included for reimbursement by Japan’s national health insurance system. Alternatively, when acid secretion can be effectively and strongly suppressed by vonoprazan, clarithromycin may not be needed for H. pylori eradication therapy. The dual therapy of amoxicillin and high-dose PPI or poor metabolizer of CYP2C19 that can maintain the intragastric pH above 6 leads to a high H. pylori eradication rate, because increasing the pH to 6 or 7 allows the bacteria to enter the replicative state where they become susceptible to amoxicillin. Strong acid suppressive effect from the first dosage and even at night by vonoprazan may lead to a high H. pylori eradication rate. To prove this theory, a clinical study is ongoing in Japan (UMIN000022963).\\nThe eradication rate with vonoprazan-based triple therapy was also better than PPI-based triple therapy in young and middle age groups, indicating that strong acid inhibition is more effective in young than in old patients who may have less acid secretion with severe atrophic changes in gastric mucosa. The effects of vonoprazan for the second-line treatment of H. pylori eradication are not well known. A meta-analysis of second-line triple therapy did not show a difference between vonoprazan and conventional PPIs. As these data were obtained from retrospective studies, confounding factors might have existed that affected these results. In a single arm vonoprazan-based second-line triple therapy with amoxicillin and metronidazole in patients who failed vonoprazan- and lansoprazole-based first-line triple therapy, the eradication rate was as high as 98%. Furthermore, vonoprazan-based triple therapies with amoxicillin and clarithromycin or with amoxicillin and metronidazole were safe and well-tolerated. Another study showed that vonoprazan-based first-line therapy with amoxicillin and clarithromycin was effective in 70.2% of patients who failed rabeprazole first-line triple therapy with amoxicillin and clarithromycin in Japan. There was even a case successfully treated with fourth-line vonoprazan-based triple therapy with amoxicillin and clarithromycin. These data indicate that the fast onset of increase and sustained increase in intragastric pH are important factors for increasing the H. pylori eradication rate. In addition, the eradication rate was higher in subjects without NAB than in those with NAB. Although there are few drug interactions, it should also be noted that vonoprazan treatment significantly decreased the value of the urea breath test (UBT). Therefore, when UBT is performed to examine H. pylori eradication, vonoprazan treatment should be stopped at least 2 weeks before the test. Although the mechanisms how vonoprazan decreases the value of UBT are not clear, previous data have shown that urease activity is strongly affected by intragastric pH, particularly pH levels above 4–5.5. Therefore, a rapid increase in intra-gastric pH in response to the early and strong acid inhibitory effect of vonoprazan may reduce urease activity.\\nGERD is one of the most common esophageal diseases, characterized by symptoms of heartburn and acid regurgitation due to reflux of the stomach contents. The prevalence of GERD diagnosed by heartburn and/or acid regurgitation symptoms in East Asia is 2.5–7.8%. The impact of GERD on quality of life (QOL) is large, and GERD is a burden on healthcare systems. The major goals of treating erosive esophagitis are to relieve symptoms, heal erosions, and prevent complications. Although host factors might exist because not all patients have abnormal gastroesophageal reflux, gastric acid is the principle factor underlying the development of reflux esophagitis, and PPIs have been the gold standard for treatment in the clinical setting. Intragastric pH above 4 holding time has been used to show the effects of acid-suppressive drugs, because erosive esophagitis can be controlled and healed when this time is long. However, the degree of acid suppression by PPIs is not complete and no data have shown that a pH of 4 is enough to control reflux symptoms. Furthermore, approximately 80% of patients with frequent heartburn experience heartburn at night, and 29% of those are awakened by coughing or choking due to gastroesophageal reflux at night. Nighttime acid reflux with NAB influences sleep quality and daytime QOL. More than 30% of patients on PPIs due to reflux esophagitis with heartburn continuously experience nocturnal heartburn; therefore, this issue is one of the unmet clinical needs. More than 50% of symptomatic GERD patients taking PPIs are not satisfied with the treatment, and more than 20% of patients take PPIs twice daily or purchase medicines over the counter in addition to their prescribed medicine.\\nThe safety and dose–response profiles of vonoprazan were evaluated in an 8-week phase II study. Patients with erosive esophagitis were treated at doses of 5, 10, 20, and 40 mg once daily for 8 weeks and compared to those who were treated with 30 mg lansoprazole once daily for 8 weeks. Vonoprazan was effective and noninferior to lansoprazole for curing erosive esophagitis. Although the study was designed to show the noninferiority of vonoprazan to lansoprazole, the healing rate of severe esophagitis (Los Angeles [LA] classification, Grades C/D) with 20 mg vonoprazan was higher than that with 30 mg lansoprazole at week 2 (96.0% vs 82.6%) (Fig. 4). In another phase II study, the noninferiority of 20 mg vonoprazan compared to 30 mg lansoprazole for treating erosive esophagitis was confirmed and the long-term efficacy of vonoprazan was evaluated. In post hoc analyses, patients with severe esophagitis (LA Grades C/D) or with extensive CYP2C19 metabolism experienced better treatment effects in the vonoprazan group than in the lansoprazole group (Table 1). Long-term (52 weeks) maintenance treatment of 10 mg or 20 mg vonoprazan resulted in less than 10% erosive esophagitis recurrence and vonoprazan was well-tolerated overall. Vonoprazan was also assessed for the treatment of refractory GERD compared to conventional PPI. In an open label study, vonoprazan was effective for the treatment of PPI (standard single-dose)-refractory symptomatic GERD (Table 1). Because this was an open label study, potential bias may have existed. However, the symptoms were quickly relieved in the study, and this effect might have correlated with the potent inhibition of acid production from the first dose of vonoprazan. Doses of 20 mg and 40 mg vonoprazan significantly inhibited gastric acid secretion after 24 hours and treated erosive esophagitis that was resistant to standard dose of conventional PPIs (Table 1). Further studies are warranted to prove the rapid relief of GERD symptoms by vonoprazan.\\nRandomized, controlled trials confirmed the noninferiority of vonoprazan for the 8-week treatment of gastric ulcer (93.5% and 93.8% for vonoprazan and lansoprazole, respectively). However, the noninferiority of vonoprazan compared to lansoprazole for the 6-week treatment of duodenal ulcer was not confirmed in the trial (95.5% and 98.3% for vonoprazan and lansoprazole, respectively). The factors that affected these data might have correlated with dropout subjects who did not complete the study and were counted as non-healed subjects. Some of the subjects might have stopped the study because their symptoms were quickly relieved by vonoprazan or lansoprazole. Further studies are needed to conclude the efficacy of vonoprazan for the treatment of gastric and duodenal ulcers.\\nNSAIDs cause gastrointestinal (GI) ulcers and increase the risk of serious GI complications. Risk factors associated with the occurrence of NSAID-related ulcers are history of GI ulcer with bleeding, concomitant use of two or more NSAIDs/low-dose aspirin (LDA), high dose of NSAIDs, concomitant use of anticoagulant agent, history of gastric and duodenal ulcers, age over 70 years, and H. pylori infection. NSAID use and H. pylori infection are independent and synergistic risk factors for gastric and duodenal ulcers and bleeding. This is the most important point when considering NSAID-related gastric and duodenal ulcer and complications. Furthermore, not only NSAID and H. pylori infection but also host factors are involved in the development of ulcers. However, it is still not clear what definitive host factors are involved in the development of ulcers in H. pylori-infected patients and/or NSAID users. Therefore, patients at risk should discontinue NSAID use. However, this is sometimes not easy or feasible, as the continuous use of NSAIDs can control pain and improve QOL in patients with chronic pain. LDA can also decrease the recurrence of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. In these cases, concomitant use of gastroprotective agents including PPI should be considered.\\nA meta-analysis showed that PPIs significantly reduced the risk of NSAID-associated ulcers compared to placebo, and NSAIDs plus PPI was the most cost-effective strategy for preventing upper GI ulcers in patients on long-term NSAID therapy. A dose of 20 mg esomeprazole once daily was effective and safe for preventing NSAID-associated upper GI ulcer recurrence. Because NSAID-associated upper GI injury is pH-dependent, the higher the in-tragastric pH, the lower the incidence of injury. Vonoprazan strongly inhibits acid production from the first dose. No clinically meaningful interactions during concomitant use of vonoprazan and NSAIDs were observed, and vonoprazan was well-tolerated when administered with LDA or NSAIDs. Therefore, the efficacy and safety of vonoprazan for preventing NSAID-associated upper GI ulcer recurrence has been evaluated in patients continuously receiving NSAIDs in double-blind, randomized trials. Vonoprazan (10 mg and 20 mg) was effective for NSAID-associated upper GI secondary ulcer prevention. These results were consistent with previous studies that investigated the effect of PPIs in NSAID-associated secondary ulcer prevention. No unexpected adverse events were identified during at least a 1-year period of exposure to vonoprazan. After these data were introduced, the Japanese government approved 10 mg vonoprazan for the prevention of recurrent upper GI ulcers during long-term NSAID therapy.\\nThe efficacy and safety of vonoprazan for preventing recurrent upper GI ulcer in patients with long-term LDA therapy was evaluated in a phase III study. The rate of gastric and duodenal ulcer recurrence after 24 weeks of LDA therapy was 2.8%, and was 0.5% with 15 mg lansoprazole or 10 mg vonoprazan. Thus, 10 mg vonoprazan is as effective as 15 mg lansoprazole for preventing recurrent upper GI ulcer during LDA therapy. Vonoprazan treatment resulted in lower ulcer recurrence rates and upper GI bleeding compared to lansoprazole during long-term LDA treatment. Vonoprazan has long-term safety (at least 24 weeks) and is well-tolerated.\\nThe more acid that is secreted, the more that effective acid suppression is needed, and the more the effects of vonoprazan stand out. When vonoprazan is used for short-term acid suppression, there are no problematic side effects. However, when long-term acid suppression treatment is needed, side effects such as hypergastrinemia, pneumonia, small bowel bacterial overgrowth, and Clostridium difficile infection may occur. In clinical trials evaluating the safety and tolerability of vonoprazan for GERD and LDA/NSAID-associated upper GI secondary ulcer prevention, the common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) irrespective of causal relationship to study medication with an incidence of ≥ 5% in vonoprazan 10 mg and 20 mg were nasopharyngitis, diarrhea, constipation, upper respiratory tract inflammation, fall, gastroenteritis, and eczema. Most TEAEs were classified as mild in intensity. To verify the long-term safety and efficacy of vonoprazan, a study evaluating the safety of 5-year maintenance therapy of 10 mg or 20 mg vonoprazan in patients with healed erosive esophagitis is ongoing in Japan (NCT02679508).\\nIn conclusion, vonoprazan is superior to conventional PPIs for suppressing acid secretion, especially at night, and there was no difference in efficacy depending on CYP2C19 genotype status. In addition, vonoprazan was shown to overcome the weaknesses associated with conventional PPIs. The advantages of vonoprazan compared to previous P-CABs are that it does not have the hepatic toxicity observed with previous P-CABs, and it has slow dissociation from H+, K+-ATPase while its actions are long-lasting. In clinical trials, vonoprazan showed potent acid-suppressive effects, and rapid and long-lasting effects for the treatment of acid-related diseases including reflux esophagitis, LDA/NSAID-associated ulcer recurrence, and H. pylori infection. It also had satisfactory safety and tolerability after at least 1 year of treatment. Thus, vonoprazan may address the unmet medical need for the treatment of acid-related diseases.'},\n",

       "    'fulltext': 'Recently, the number of Japanese patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) has increased due to changes in eating habits and a decrease in Helicobacter pylori (HP) infections. In Japan, heartburn is a pervasive problem in Japan that interferes with daily life. Therefore, alleviating symptoms must be the primary objective in the treatment of symptomatic GERD patients. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are widely used worldwide as a treatment for acid-related diseases (such as GERD and peptic ulcer disease) and a component of eradication therapy for HP. However, acid-suppressive therapy with PPIs has several limitations. Most GERD patients can be managed with standard PPI regimens; approximately 10–40% of patients have refractory symptoms. For patients with acid-related diseases, rapid onset of a drug that leads to the alleviation of symptoms is important.\\nPotassium-competitive acid blockers (P-CABs) are a new class of gastric acid suppressants. Similarly to PPIs, P-CABs inhibit gastric hydrogen/potassium adenosine triphosphatase (H+/K+-ATPase); however, dissimilarly to PPIs, P-CABs inhibit K+ competitively and reversibly. Vonoprazan is a new orally active P-CAB that was discovered and synthesized by Takeda Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Japan. Vonoprazan accumulates in the gastric tissue and remains for a long period; consequently, it has a long-lasting and potent anti-secretory effect on H+/K+-ATPase.\\nTo date, there have been few studies directly comparing the effects of vonoprazan and PPIs. Sakurai et al. reported that the acid-inhibitory effect (pH\\xa04 holding time ratio) of vonoprazan is significantly greater than that of PPIs. Our previous study demonstrated that H2-receptor antagonists increase the intragastric pH faster than PPIs during the early post-administration phase. No study has directly compared the intragastric pH of vonoprazan (a new class of PPIs), lansoprazole (a conventional PPI) and famotidine (an H2-receptor antagonist; H2RA). Thus, we designed a three-way crossover study to compare the early effects of vonoprazan, lansoprazole and famotidine by using pH monitoring.\\nWe performed a randomized, three-way crossover study. It was conducted in 10 healthy male volunteers, aged between 20 and 37 years (mean age of 26.9 years) who did not take gastric acid secretion inhibitors such as H2Ras and/or PPIs. Prior to the study, we tested anti-HP immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies (SRL, Tokyo, Japan), and all subjects were negative.\\nIn this three-way crossover study, all subjects received a single oral dosage of vonoprazan (20\\xa0mg) (Takecab®, Takeda Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.), a single oral dosage of lansoprazole (30\\xa0mg) (Takepron®, Takeda Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.) and a single oral dosage of famotidine (20\\xa0mg) (Gaster®, Astellas Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Japan) in a crossover manner with a random sequence. Each of these drugs was administered for more than seven days. The subjects were requested to fast on the night before treatment (at least 8\\xa0h) and for a period of 6\\xa0h after drug administration. All medicines were given in the morning.\\nUnder local anaesthesia, the subjects were nasally inserted with the pH electrode. The electrode tip was placed in the stomach. The intragastric pH was measured at 10-s intervals by a portable pH meter equipped with an antimony pH electrode (Chemical Instrument Co. Ltd.). Prior to each study, the pH electrode was calibrated by using standard buffer solutions of pH\\xa04.01 and 6.86. The obtained pH data were analysed using computer software (Chemical Instrument Co., Ltd.). We measured the average pH, the average pH per hour, and the pH holding time at 6 h after each drug administration.\\nWe used Wilcoxon’s signed-rank test for the data. The significance level was set at a p value of <0.05. All statistical analyses used the StatView program (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).\\nThis study was enforced according to the Declaration of Helsinki. The Yokohama City University Medical School Ethics Committee approved the study protocol and received written informed consent from all participants. This study is registered to the University Hospital Medical Information Network (UMIN) clinical trials registry (UMIN000020989). All authors had access to the clinical data and approved the final version of the manuscript.\\nAll 10 volunteers completed the study protocol, and adverse events were not reported.\\nThe average pH during the 6-h period after administration was significantly higher with famotidine than with lansoprazole (median: 4.45 vs 2.65; p\\xa0=\\xa00.0284). Similar results were found for vonoprazan and lansoprazole (median: 4.30 vs 2.65; p\\xa0=\\xa00.0322). No significant differences were found between famotidine and vonoprazan (median: 4.45 vs 4.30; p\\xa0= 0.7581) (Fig.\\xa01).\\nThe average pH was significantly higher after the administration of famotidine than that after lansoprazole during the 1–2, 2–3 and 3–4\\xa0h study periods (median: 5.10 vs 3.10; p\\xa0=\\xa00.0069, 5.65 vs 3.25; p\\xa0=\\xa00.0217, 5.75 vs 2.85; p\\xa0=\\xa00.0208). No significant differences were observed in the 0–1, 4–5, and 5–6\\xa0h study periods. The average pH was significantly higher after the administration of vonoprazan than after lansoprazole during the 3–4, 4–5 and 5–6\\xa0h study periods (median: 5.20 vs 2.85; p\\xa0=\\xa00.0411, 6.00 vs 2.95; p\\xa0=\\xa00.0165, 5.00 vs 2.55; p\\xa0=\\xa00.0365). No significant differences were observed in the 0–1, 1–2 and 2–3\\xa0h study periods (Fig.\\xa02).\\nIn the 6-h study period, the administration of famotidine caused a longer duration of pH >5 or 6 than did the administration of lansoprazole (median: 39.65% vs 10.6%; p\\xa0=\\xa00.0125, 35.3% vs 3.25%; p\\xa0=\\xa00.0125). Similar results were found for vonoprazan and lansoprazole (median: 45.6% vs 10.6%; p\\xa0=\\xa00.0367, 38.55% vs 3.25%; p\\xa0=\\xa00.0218) (Fig.\\xa03).\\nIn this study, we examined the change in the intragastric pH in the early stage after a single oral administration of vonoprazan, lansoprazole or famotidine in HP-negative subjects. Vonoprazan and famotidine had a significantly faster onset of action and caused a stronger suppression of gastric acid secretion than did lansoprazole.\\nLansoprazole is a benzimidazole class of anti-secretory agents and the second approved PPI in Japan. Lansoprazole inhibits gastric acid H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cells forming part of the proton pump that performs acid secretion. Lansoprazole is widely used for treating reflux oesophagitis, peptic ulcer diseases such as gastric and duodenal ulcers, and maintenance treatment of erosive oesophagitis. Most PPIs, including lansoprazole, are metabolized and inactivated by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 of the liver enzyme cytochrome P450. There are genetic polymorphisms of extensive CYP2C19 metabolizers and poor metabolizers in CYP2C19, and significant differences in plasma drug concentration have been observed. These factors affect the degree of inhibition of acid secretion.\\nBy contrast, famotidine is metabolized by the kidney and not the liver. Thus, the inhibition of acid secretion by famotidine is not affected by the CYP2C19 phenotype or genotype status.\\nVonoprazan is a P-CAB that represents a new class of gastric-acid-suppressive agents. Vonoprazan was approved for use in HP eradication in addition to peptic ulcer and reflux esophagitis in Japan. Nishizawa et al. reported that with clarithromycin-based triple therapy, Vonoprazan is a better choice of antisecretory agent compared to PPIs, especially in young to middle-aged patients.\\nVonoprazan is metabolized and inactivated by CYP3A4 of the liver enzyme cytochrome P450. A phase I study of vonoprazan in healthy male volunteers has revealed that it rapidly and strongly inhibits gastric acid secretion within 24\\xa0h after a single dose in the range of 20–120\\xa0mg. Furthermore, the pharmacokinetics of vonoprazan is not affected by the CYP2C19 genotype.\\nThe poor-metabolizer phenotype of CYP2C19 recognizes the difference in occurrence frequency among races. Poor metabolizers account for only 2% to 6% in Caucasians and 9% to 23% in Japanese individuals. We also confirmed genetic polymorphisms in our study; three of the 10 subjects (33.3%) were poor metabolizers. Possibly, the plasma drug concentration of lansoprazole was high in these three subjects, but in this study, there was no significant difference between poor metabolizers and extensive metabolizers regarding intragastric acidity.\\nTreatment with PPIs is known to be the most effective means of healing peptic ulcers. In addition, PPIs provide more effective and prompt ulcer healing than H2RAs, with respect to the alleviation of symptoms. However, our study demonstrated that H2RA increased the intragastric pH more rapidly than a conventional PPI did. Prior studies have shown that the repeated oral or intravenous administration of PPIs was effective in suppressing acid secretion. In addition, the stable effects of PPIs are achieved after approximately 5 days. Another study showed that a single initial dose of a PPI failed to achieve an intragastric pH >4 on the first day of treatment. However, a PPI was more effective than an H2RA in suppressing acid secretion in healthy volunteers, patients with duodenal ulcers and patients with GERD after 5 to 7 days of treatment. In an autoradiography study, H2RAs bound to all parietal cells uniformly, whereas PPIs bound only to young activated parietal cells. In the early period of drug treatment, the anti-secretory action of PPIs had a slower onset than that of H2RAs. It appears that the suppression of gastric acid secretion by H2RAs is superior to that by PPIs. However, H2RAs have disadvantages of a relatively short duration of action, the development of tolerance, and an incomplete suppression of acid secretion in response to diet.\\nSome of GEED patients are reported to be refractory to PPI therapy. Kawai et al. reported combination therapy with Rikkunshito and a PPI improves quality of life in patients with patients with PPI-refractory GERD. Studies for P-CAB, which strongly inhibits acid secretion than PPI, refractory GERD are also necessary in the future.\\nPatients receiving treatment at a therapeutic dose of conventional PPIs sometimes experience insufficient gastric acid inhibition at night. This phenomenon is generally called nocturnal acid breakthrough (NAB) and is defined as a stomach pH of <4 for over 1\\xa0h. Acid reflux at night can worsen GERD symptoms that are improving. Therefore, suppression of persistent acid reflux during the night is considered important for alleviating symptoms. H2RAs are globally used to treat NAB, but it is known that the effects of H2RAs decrease with sequential administration.\\nMost patients with mild GERD and infrequent symptoms use a PPI only when symptoms appear. On-demand therapy for patients with mild GERD after receiving initial therapy with PPIs improves the quality of daily life and is cost effective. The rapid acid suppression effect is important in on-demand therapy aiming at improving heartburn. Although many patients experience heartburn after meals, H2RAs are inappropriate for treatments to suppress acid secretion in response to diet because the condition of the stomach after meals slows the effectiveness of H2RAs.\\nThe main cause of GERD symptoms is believed to be acid reflux to the oesophagus. The long-term suppression of gastric acid control is necessary for GERD symptoms. However, the heartburn associated with mild GERD is a temporary symptom, mainly due to short-term gastric acid reflux. Therefore, rapid onset and long-term acid suppression play important roles in eliminating these symptoms.\\nOur results showed no significant differences between famotidine and vonoprazan. However, vonoprazan is characterized by not requiring activation by acid and is effective even when administered on an empty stomach. Therefore, vonoprazan is considered an agent useful for on-demand therapy and for patients with NAB because it can quickly suppress gastric acid secretion.\\nOral administration of vonoprazan and famotidine in HP-negative healthy male subjects caused the intragastric pH to rise more quickly than did lansoprazole. This result shows that vonoprazan may be suitable for initial therapy, on-demand therapy and patients with NAB.\\nKO analysed and collected the clinical data and wrote the manuscript, with contributions from KF.

       "    'fulltext': \"Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD), which was developed in Japan in the late 1990s, has been performed in many countries in recent years; with ESD, the 5-year survival rate of patients with early gastric cancer (EGC) exceeds 90%.\\nSeveral complications of ESD are known, the most important of which is post-ESD bleeding. As ulcer healing prevents post-ESD bleeding, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are widely prescribed as the first-line therapy for artificial ulcers developing after ESD.\\nRecently, a novel potassium-competitive acid blocker (P-CAB) termed vonoprazan (TAKECAB; Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) was developed. P-CAB exhibits a more powerful and longer antisecretory effect on H+/K+-ATPase than do PPIs. P-CAB was reported to be more effective than PPIs in the healing of gastroduodenal ulcers. Thus, P-CAB would be expected to afford better healing of artificial ulcers developing after ESD.\\nWe began to investigate the effect of P-CAB on the healing of post-ESD artificial ulcers in March 2015 (trial UMIN000016835). To date, four comparative studies have examined the extent of artificial ulcer healing afforded by P-CAB compared with PPIs. However, the results were controversial, and further work was required. Here, we examined the effects of vonoprazan compared with those of esomeprazole on the healing of post-ESD artificial ulcers in a prospective, multicenter, two-arm, randomized controlled trial (RCT) and found that the extent of healing of artificial ulcers after ESD was identical when either P-CAB or PPI was prescribed.\\nWe conducted a prospective study between May 2015 and May 2017 at two university hospitals (Yokohama City University Hospital, Yokohama, Japan, and Yokohama City University Medical Center, Yokohama, Japan). The study protocol was approved by the ethics review boards of both hospitals, and the trial was registered with the University Hospital Medical Information Network (number MIN000016835) and performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.\\nPatients diagnosed with EGC or gastric adenoma and treated via ESD at either hospital were recruited. We included patients who were\\u2009≥\\u200920 years of age and provided written informed consent. Conversely, our exclusion criteria were (i) continuous prescription of any medicine that could interact with vonoprazan or esomeprazole (e.g., another PPI or an H2 receptor blocker); (ii) prescription of NSAIDs, steroids, anticoagulants, and/or antithrombotic agents; (iii) pregnancy; (iv) any serious disease rendering ESD difficult; (v) a past history of resection of the upper gastrointestinal tract; or (vi) considered incompetent by a doctor.\\nA total of 60 patients were randomly (and equally) divided into a vonoprazan group (V group) and an esomeprazole group (E group) using QMinim Online Minimization (http://qminim.sourceforge.net) prior to ESD. We divided age, sex, Helicobacter pylori infection, and diabetes into stratification. Neither the physicians nor the patients were blinded to group status. All patients were given injections of 20\\u2009mg of omeprazole twice daily on the day of ESD and on the next day. Two days after ESD, 20\\u2009mg of vonoprazan and 300\\u2009mg of rebamipide (V group) or 20\\u2009mg of esomeprazole and 300\\u2009mg of rebamipide (E group) were prescribed orally (daily) for 8 weeks. E group is the regular follow-up of each hospital. To evaluate the sizes and conditions of all artificial ulcers, the patients underwent upper endoscopy on the day after ESD and at 4 and 8 weeks later (Figure 1). The major and minor axes of the ulcers were measured endoscopically (M2-4K; Olympus Corp., Tokyo, Japan) (Figure 2). Assuming that each ulcer was an ellipse, the ulcer area (in mm2) was calculated using the following formula: (major\\u2009axis/2) × (minor\\u2009axis/2) × π.\\nWe performed ESD using a single-channel endoscope (GIF-Q260J; Olympus Corp.) or via multiangle two-channel endoscopy (GIF-2TQ260M; Olympus Corp.). The injection solution contained glycerol, hyaluronic acid sodium (0.4% [w/v]), and 0.001% (w/v) epinephrine and was locally injected into the submucosal layer using a disposable 23-gauge needle (Top Corp., Tokyo, Japan). The ITknife2 (KD-611L; Olympus Corp.) was the primary cutting device used, but we occasionally employed a DualKnife (KD-650U; Olympus Corp.). An electrosurgical current was applied with the aid of an electrosurgical generator (VIO300D or ICC200; ERBE Elektromedizin GmbH, Tubingen, Germany). Ulcers that developed after ESD were carefully examined endoscopically and any visible vessels clipped (EZ Clip; Olympus Corp.) and/or heat-coagulated using hemostatic forceps (Coagrasper, FD410LR; Olympus Corp.) in all patients in both groups.\\nOur primary endpoint was the shrinkage rate of the artificial ulcers 4 and 8 weeks after ESD. The shrinkage rate was calculated using the following formula: ([ESD\\u2009specimen\\u2009area] − [ulcerated\\u2009area\\u2009at\\u20094\\u2009or\\u20098\\u2009weeks\\u2009after\\u2009ESD])/(ESD\\u2009specimen\\u2009area) × 100(%). The ulcer healing rate (scarring at stage S1 or S2) was also noted. In addition, we compared the post-ESD bleeding rates. Post-ESD bleeding was defined as a clinical episode of hematemesis and/or melena and/or a decline in the hemoglobin level to below 2\\u2009g/dL.\\nWe used Fisher's exact test to compare quantitative variables (sex, Helicobacter pylori infection status, diabetes, and tumor location). The Mann–Whitney U test was employed to compare age, ulcer area, and ulcer cure rate. P values\\u2009<\\u20090.05 were considered to reflect statistical significance. Patient ages and ESD specimen areas are presented as medians with interquartile ranges (IQRs). The IQR is a measure of statistical dispersion, being the difference between the 75th and 25th percentiles, or between the upper and lower quartiles.\\nAll statistical analyses were performed with the aid of EZR software (Saitama Medical Center, Jichi Medical University, Saitama, Japan), which is a graphical user interface for R (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). More precisely, EZR is a modified version of the R commander with additional statistical functions used frequently by biostatisticians.\\nIn consideration of the cure healing rate of vonoprazan and esomeprazole in the previous report, it was judged that there was a significant difference in 72 patients, and this study was conducted. Intermediate analysis was carried out when 60 patients finished, because there was no difference, this study was terminated. Their distributions between the two participating institutions are shown in Table 1. We randomly divided the enrolled patients into two groups of 30 patients each. We excluded 3 patients of the V group and 4 patients of the E group, finally analyzing 27 and 26 patients, respectively. The reasons for exclusion in the V group (n = 3) were surgical treatment (n = 1), a suspected allergic reaction (n = 1), and a perforation (n = 1); in the E group (n = 4), the reasons for exclusion were surgical treatment (n = 3) and loss to follow-up as defined in the protocol (n = 1). Drug compliance exceeded 90% in all patients. Several clinical characteristics that delay ulcer healing have been reported. Therefore, we analyzed the data with respect to age, sex, H. pylori infection status, the presence of diabetes mellitus, and tumor location but found no significant difference between the two groups in terms of any factor (Table 2). We also analyzed tumor size, specimen size, and procedure duration, which are known as risk factors of post-ESD bleeding, but found no significant difference between the two groups in terms of any factor (Table 2). H. pylori infection rate in this study was lower than that of Japanese general population, because H. pylori has been eradicated before ESD in some patients.\\nThe median areas of the ESD artificial ulcers were 961.8 (IQR: 707.7–1380.0) mm2 and 880.8 (IQR: 588.8–1638.8) mm2 in the V group and E group, respectively. We performed endoscopic follow-up at 4 and 8 weeks after ESD. The proportions of subjects with ulcer scarring of stage S1 or S2 after ESD were 8.0% (2/27) and 11.5% (3/26) at 4 weeks (P = 0.669) and 88.9% (24/27) and 84.6% (22/26) at 8 weeks (P = 0.420) in the V and E groups, respectively (Table 3). The 4-week shrinkage rates of artificial ulcers were 96.8% (range: 72.0–100%) in the V group and 97.5% (range: 75.8–100%) in the E group, thus not significantly different between the V and E groups (P = 0.656) (Figure 3). The 8-week shrinkage rates of artificial ulcers were 100% in both groups, thus lacking any significant difference (P = 0.257) (Table 3). In terms of delayed bleeding, no obvious bleeding was observed in either group. As the healing of artificial ulcers after ESD did not differ when vonoprazan or esomeprazole was prescribed, both drugs effectively aided artificial ulcer healing after ESD.\\nWe sought to clarify the effects of vonoprazan and esomeprazole on the healing of post-ESD artificial ulcers by designing a prospective, multicenter, two-arm RCT. We found no significant difference between vonoprazan and esomeprazole in terms of artificial ulcer healing after ESD. Statistically, no factor associated with delayed ulcer healing was evident. As the study was performed at two centers, nine physicians (ranging from beginners to experts) performed ESD, but their various skill levels did not affect the results.\\nOf the four previous reports comparing artificial ulcer healing using P-CAB and PPIs, three found that P-CAB was superior to PPIs in terms of post-ESD ulcer shrinkage rates or late bleeding rates. However, no obvious differences in ulcer shrinkage rate were found in either our present study or another report. Differences among the results of the five studies (including this study) are probably due to differences in protocols, patient selection, and other variables. We excluded patients who were taking NSAIDs, steroids, anticoagulants, and/or antithrombotic agents to minimize situations where other medications might influence the effects of P-CAB or PPIs. Therefore, it may be that we found no significant difference because we selectively excluded patients with comorbidities (which the other studies did not). In particular, excluding patients on antithrombotic therapy may explain the absence of bleeding in our study. Although we cannot mention about post-ESD bleeding assertively in our study, we analyzed several factors (tumor size, specimen size, and procedure duration), which are known as risk factors of post-ESD bleeding. As a result, there was no significant difference in any of them (Table 2). Another difference is that our study did not feature a monotherapy protocol; we added oral rebamipide because a previous meta-analysis showed that treatment with PPIs plus rebamipide was superior to PPIs monotherapy in terms of the healing of ESD-induced ulcers over 4 weeks, particularly large ulcers. As patients should not be disadvantaged during clinical trials, we considered that monotherapy would not be ethical. Also, the median ESD specimen area in the present study was only 942\\u2009mm2, thus small compared to those of previous reports (1256\\u2009mm2 and 1114.7\\u2009mm2). The low rate of H. pylori infection may also be a factor that did not differ significantly in ulcer shrinkage rate.\\nVonoprazan action is barely affected by the CYP2C19 genotype, and the drug affords more potent and longer antisecretory effects on H+/K+-ATPase than do conventional PPIs. Therefore, vonoprazan has been widely prescribed in Japan for the treatment of gastric ulcers, for H. pylori eradication, and for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease in the time since its release in 2015. Although vonoprazan inhibits acid production irrespective of CYP2C19 status more potently than does esomeprazole, CYP2C19 status is associated with approximately a threefold lower intrinsic clearance of the S-isomer of esomeprazole compared with the R-isomer and omeprazole. Esomeprazole is less affected by metabolism than are the other PPIs. In fact, as we found no significant difference between the drugs in the present study, it may be unnecessary to strongly inhibit gastric acid secretion during artificial ulcer healing.\\nThe limitations of our study include the mode of administration of drugs and the method that we used to measure ulcer area. We did not simply compare the effects of vonoprazan and esomeprazole because we gave rebamipide and omeprazole intravenously. However, we considered that we should not disadvantage the patients. Also, monotherapy is not prescribed in actual clinical practice. As various treatments are available, we concluded that our protocol was the most appropriate. We earlier thoroughly evaluated the method that we used to measure ulcers. The stomach can be easily expanded and contracted by supplying, and then removing, gas via an endoscope. However, the stomach is of course a three-dimensional structure. As endoscopic images can be captured from flat surfaces only, the accuracies of our area measurements may have been compromised. The reason that we used our previously reported method is that the region just after the ESD lies closest to the ESD sample area (data not shown).\\nIn conclusion, we found no difference in terms of artificial ulcer healing after ESD using rebamipide in combination with either vonoprazan or esomeprazole in low-risk patients with late bleeding. Vonoprazan strongly suppresses gastric acid secretion, but there was no great need for the use of this drug during the healing of artificial ulcers after ESD; esomeprazole exerted a sufficient therapeutic effect. No post-ESD bleeding was observed. We consider that both vonoprazan and esomeprazole effectively aided artificial ulcer healing and esomeprazole was superior to vonoprazan in view of cost benefit in low-risk patients.\\nNo author has any conflict of interest to declare concerning the content of this manuscript.\"},\n",

       "    'fulltext': 'Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a condition that caused symptoms such as heartburn\\xa0and acid regurgitation due to backflow of stomach contents, and the prevalence rate of GERD has dramatically increased in Japan. The first drug for GERD treatment and prevention of the recurrence is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). Recently, potassium-competitive acid blocker (P-CAB) which exerts stronger and more stable acid suppressive effect than PPI was put on the market in Japan. Owing to its pharmacological action, unlike PPI, P-CAB shows the maximum acid suppressive effect immediately after administration, and it has the characteristic that the acid suppressive effect lasts for a few days after discontinuation of the administration. Therefore, a single administration of P-CAB showed significant acid suppressive effect compared with double-dose administration of PPI, and its efficacy against PPI-resistant GERD has been confirmed. Since the incidence of relapse becomes high after the initial treatment of GERD, maintenance therapy with PPI is required to prevent recurrence. As maintenance therapy of GERD, there are continuous administration, intermittent administration, and discontinuous (on demand) administration of PPI. Also in GERD clinical practice guideline 2015, maintenance therapy for mild reflux esophagitis which accounts for 90% of the total of GERD recommends step-down therapy to reduce the dose to the minimum if symptom control is possible. If symptoms are suppressed by daily administration, it is common to take half-dose administration or every other day administration or intermittent therapy as the next step. From the pharmacological characteristics of P-CAB, it is presumed that there is no significant difference in acid suppressive effect between daily administration and every other day administration of P-CAB. On the other hand, since PPI has a slow onset of effect and maximum acid suppression is achieved on the 4–5 days after daily administration, it is considered that acid suppressive effect cannot be sufficiently obtained by PPI every other day administration.\\nFor easily relapsing GERD in which recurrence of symptoms easily occurs due to discontinuation of PPI administration, it is difficult to transfer from continuous administration of PPI as GERD maintenance therapy to dosage reduction, intermittent administration, or discontinuous administration as step-down therapy. P-CAB every other day administration can be expected for such cases also.\\nThere have been no studies showing the usefulness of PPI and P-CAB every other day in the maintenance therapy of GERD, and in the studies comparing P-CAB and PPI in maintenance therapy, there are only results of clinical trials for new drug applications. \\nThis study aims to clarify the usefulness of P-CAB every other day administration as GERD maintenance therapy by cross\\xa0over with PPI every other day administration. If P-CAB every other day administration is established as one of GERD maintenance therapies, there is merit in both medical cost reduction and the safety to alleviate elevation in serum gastrin.\\nThis study is a prospective, multicentre, open-label, two-period randomised cross-over study to compare the efficacy and safety of PPI every other day administration and P-CAB every other day administration in 120 patients who receive erosive GERD maintenance therapy with PPI.\\nPatients will randomly and equally allocated to the two treatment sequences, sequence PCPP\\xa0(P-CAB during period 1 and PPI during period 2) and sequence PPPC\\xa0(PPI during period 1 and P-CAB during period 2). During the first 4\\u2009weeks period defined as period 1, patients in sequence PCPP and sequence PPPC will first receive P-CAB and PPI, respectively. After period 1, patients in sequences PCPP and PPPC will be crossed over to receive P-CAB and PPI, respectively, for 4 weeks as period 2 (figure 1). There is no washout period.\\nNational Hospital Organization Kanazawa Medical Center\\nNational Hospital Organization Tokyo Medical Center\\nNational Hospital Organization Osaka National Hospital\\nNational Hospital Organization Kure Medical Center\\nNational Hospital Organization Okayama Medical Center\\nNational Hospital Organization Kyushu Medical Center\\nNational Hospital Organization Osaka Minami Medical Center\\nNational Hospital Organization Higashihiroshima Medical Center\\nNational Hospital Organization Kochi National Hospital\\nNational Hospital Organization Mie Chuo Medical Center\\nNational Hospital Organization Kyoto Medical Center\\nNational Hospital Organization Hokkaido Medical Center\\nNational Hospital Organization Sendai Medical Center\\nNational Hospital Organization Fukuoka-higashi Medical Center\\nNational Hospital Organization Disaster Medical Center\\nNational Hospital Organization Fukuyama Medical Center\\nNational Hospital Organization Matsumoto Medical Center\\nNational Hospital Organization Hakodate National Hospital\\npatients with erosive GERD diagnosed with grade A to D by Los Angeles Classification by an endoscopic examination\\nreceiving PPI maintenance therapy with reflux esophagitis\\naged over 20 years at the time of consent\\nthose provided written consent by their free will.\\nPatients who fulfil all of the following criteria are included: \\nreceiving P-CAB administration\\nfor those PPI maintenance therapy is ineffective\\nhaving undergone gastro-oesophageal surgery\\nin very bad compliance\\nallergic to PPI or vonoprazan\\nwith serious complications such as heart failure, renal failure or hepatic failure\\npregnant, breastfeeding, or possibly pregnant\\nthe patients who are administered drugs having influence to CYP2C19, for example, antidepressant, antiplatelet, anticoagulant and antifungal\\ndeemed inappropriate for participation in this study by the principal investigator\\xa0(PI)/subinvestigators.\\nPatients who fulfil any of the following criteria are excluded: \\nVonoprazan: a Takecab tablet 10\\u2009mg (Takeda Pharmaceutical) is administered orally once.\\nLansoprazole: a Takepron once a day tablet 15\\u2009mg (Takeda Pharmaceutical) or a generic product of the same drug is administered orally once.\\nA Takecab tablet 10\\u2009mg is administered orally once every other day, and it is administered 14 times in 28 days.\\nA Takepron once a day tablet 15\\u2009mg or a generic product of the same drug is administered orally once every other day for 14 times in 28 days.\\nIf there is a relapse of symptoms during the treatment period, the same drug as initial allocation is administered according to the symptoms on the days that are supposed to be rest days.\\nAllocation of the study subjects to each treatment group is performed by the central registration system. The enrolled patients will be allocated randomly on electronic data capture (EDC) according to the random number table.\\nSymptoms such as heartburn and acid regurgitation and the number of consumed tables will be assessed for all patients by diary records.\\nF scale, Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) and serum gastrin level will be measured at baseline and at 4 weeks and at 8 weeks.\\nIn this study, EDC system is used. The PI or a person nominated by the PI logs into EDC using a strictly controlled individual electronic signature (ID and password), promptly inputs the collected case information to EDC, and sends it to the data centre. The transmitted electronic data is regarded as a case report. The PI or the person nominated by the PI performs all inputs and corrections, makes inquiries within the EDC as necessary, and responds to inquiries prepared by the data manager. The PI confirms that all data inputs are accurate.\\nThe data manager of this study will monitor the input data that caused doubt by EDC at any time by the central monitoring method.

It is presumed that there is no significant difference in acid suppressive effect between PPI daily administration and P-CAB every other day administration in terms of their pharmacological characteristics, and the dose of PPI every other day administration is about the same on average as that of on-demand therapy in the previous study. Accordingly, it is estimated that proportions of asymptomatic patients at 4 weeks in P-CAB administration cases (sequence PCPP) and in PPI administration cases (sequence PPPC) are 80% and 50%, and those at 8 weeks followed by cross\\xa0over for 4 weeks are 50% and 80%, respectively. In that case, the proportion of asymptomatic patients is 30%–50%\\u2009when P-CAB administration in asymptomatic cases is changed to PPI administration, and proportion of asymptomatic patients is 0%–20%\\u2009when P-CAB administration in symptomatic cases is changed to PPI administration. In sample size calculation using McNemar’s test in which the former proportion is 50% and the latter proportion is 20%, the required number of patients with alpha level of 5% and 90% power or more was 84 patients in total. Taking into consideration the dropout patients and ineligible patients which are found after registration, 60 patients in each group (120 patients in total) are taken as the target number of patients.\\nFull analysis set (FAS) consists of all patients who are randomly allocated in the study, excluding those who are in serious violation of the study protocol (eg, provided no consent\\xa0and in serious procedural violation). The primary endpoint analysis and all efficacy analyses will be conducted in FAS.\\nPer-protocol set consists of all FAS patients who receive at least one dose of study medication and did not have any major protocol violations. Major protocol violation will include patients who take more than 21 tablets during the each 4-week administration period.\\nSafety analysis set (SAF) consists of all patients who received at least one dose of study medication. SAF will be used for all safety analyses.\\nPrimary endpoint is proportion of asymptomatic patients. Proportion of asymptomatic patients will be presented as a 2×2\\u2009table for paired data and analysed using McNemar’s test for paired data to estimate the difference in sequence PCPP compared with sequence PPPC.\\nProportion of asymptomatic patients will be summarised using descriptive statistics at each time point per week and for each treatment group.

As a maintenance therapy of GERD, ‘step-down’ of PPI is performed currently if symptoms are controlled, but many patients still cannot reach the dose reduction from PPI daily administration. If the efficacy of P-CAB every other day is indicated in this study, it will be established as an option for GERD maintenance therapy and described in the GERD clinical practice guidelines. One of the benefits from P-CAB every other day administration is that it reduces medical cost by halving the dose. Since the age of Helicobacter pylori negativity is coming and the rapid increase of GERD patients is predicted, the effect of medical cost reduction is expected. As another merit, hypergastrinemia is caused by the feedback of strong acid suppressive effect of P-CAB, but P-CAB every other day administration can be expected to reduce the gastrin elevation. Increased enterochromaffin-like cells in hypergastrinemia concern development of carcinoid tumours. There is no report that hypergastrinemia caused by PPI or P-CAB directly produces carcinoid tumours in humans, but since hypergastrinemia caused by P-CAB exceeds that caused by PPI, P-CAB every other day administration as a device to suppress the elevation in serum gastrin level, even a little, is considered widely accepted in general clinic. In addition, in transition from daily administration to every other day administration, sufficient acid suppressive effect may not be obtained by PPI every other day administration. On the other hand, in the P-CAB every other day administration, since it is possible to obtain the maximum acid suppressive effect by a single administration of P-CAB, it is considered easy to transit from daily administration to every other day administration.'},\n",

       "    'fulltext': \"✓ The effects of therapeutic and supratherapeutic doses of vonoprazan on QT/QTc interval in healthy male and female subjects are unknown.\\n✓ The effect of vonoprazan on the QT/QTc interval in healthy male and female subjects was investigated in accordance with ICH E14.\\n✓ Study results provided compelling evidence on the cardiovascular safety of vonoprazan at doses of 40 mg and 120 mg in healthy adult subjects.\\n✓ The study supports the cardiovascular safety of vonoprazan, which belongs to a novel drug class for treatment of acid‐related diseases.\\nPotassium‐competitive acid blockers (P‐CABs) represent a novel class of acid‐suppressing agents that are a potential alternative to proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease.1 In contrast to PPIs, P‐CABs are acid‐stable H+, K+‐ATPase inhibitors that inhibit H+, K+‐ATPase noncovalently in a K+‐competitive manner.2 \\nVonoprazan (Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd. Osaka, Japan), launched in Japan on 26 February 2015, is an orally available P‐CAB, approved for the treatment of adult patients with acid‐related diseases including gastric ulcer, duodenal ulcer, reflux esophagitis, and the prevention of recurrence of gastric or duodenal ulcer during low‐dose aspirin or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) administration. Vonoprazan is also approved as an adjunct to Helicobacter pylori eradication in patients with gastric ulcer, duodenal ulcer, gastric mucosa‐associated lymphatic tissue (MALT) lymphoma, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, H. pylori gastritis, or after endoscopic resection of early‐stage gastric cancer.3 \\nClinical studies of single ascending doses4 (1–120 mg), as well as multiple repeated‐doses5 (10–40 mg) of vonoprazan, confirmed its tolerability in healthy subjects, with a rapid onset of action (<4 h) and prolonged duration (24 h) of action. Vonoprazan has a potent and long‐lasting antisecretory effect on H+, K+‐ATPase due to its high accumulation and slow clearance from gastric tissue.1 \\nCardiac safety studies have been an integral part of the development of investigational drugs, identifying drugs with potential cardiovascular liability as well as providing opportunities for safer drug administration regimens.6 QT prolongation is associated with cardiac arrhythmias, and may lead to torsades de pointes, which can be fatal.7 The International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) E14 guidelines recommend that all non‐antiarrhythmic drugs undergo clinical evaluation of absolute QT interval/corrected QT interval (QT/QTc) prolongation and proarrhythmic potential by means of a thorough QT/QTc study early in the course of their clinical development.8 \\nElectrocardiogram (ECG) parameters for vonoprazan in clinical trials have not shown any clinically meaningful QT/QTc prolongation.4, 5, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 Despite the lack of cardiac arrhythmic events in the extensive clinical development program, a thorough QT study was conducted to provide a definitive assessment of the effects of vonoprazan on the QT interval. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of vonoprazan, at both therapeutic and supratherapeutic doses, compared with moxifloxacin as a positive control and placebo, on the QT interval in healthy subjects. The study design was based on the ICH E14 guidance.8 \\nThis phase I, randomized, 4‐period, 4‐sequence, double‐blind, placebo‐ and active‐controlled (moxifloxacin/open label), crossover study examined the effect of vonoprazan 40 mg, vonoprazan 120 mg, and moxifloxacin 400 mg on the QT/QTc interval of healthy male and female subjects (Figure 1). The study was conducted between January and April 2012 at a single site in Rennes, France. The study design followed the general design principles outlined in the ICH‐E14 guidance for the clinical evaluation of the QT/QTc interval with non‐antiarrhythmic drugs (M. Hayashi, H. Jenkins, D. Crawford, and R. Jenkins, Takeda Global Investigator's Brochure TAK‐438, vonoprazan fumarate). This study was conducted in compliance with the Institutional Review Board regulations stated in Title 21 of the United States Code of Federal Regulations Part 56, Good Clinical Practice regulations and guidelines, the Declaration of Helsinki, and all applicable local regulations. All participants provided informed consent before initiation of any study‐related procedure. This trial was registered in the European Clinical Trials Database Registry (EudraCT) under registration number 2011‐004003‐20.\\nEligible subjects for the phase I QT/QTc study included healthy males and females between 18 and 55 years of age with a body mass index (BMI) ≥18 and ≤30 kg/m2. Women were of nonchild‐bearing potential or agreed to protocol‐specified methods of contraception. All subjects had clinical laboratory evaluations within the reference range of the testing laboratory. Subjects were excluded if they had received any investigational compound within 90 days before the first dose of the study drug, or if they had previously received vonoprazan. Subjects were also excluded if there was evidence or a history of clinically significant cardiovascular, neurologic, hepatic, hematologic, respiratory, renal, allergic, metabolic, or endocrine disease; current or recent (within 6 months) gastrointestinal disease; any condition impairing optimal drug absorption; any additional risk factors for torsades de pointes; QT interval corrected by Fridericia formula (QTcF) >430 ms for males or >450 ms for females, PR interval >240 ms or QRS interval >110 ms, or bradycardia (<45 bpm) at the screening or baseline visit or before dosing; positive test for human immunodeficiency virus antibody, and for any other prespecified exclusion criterion.\\nVonoprazan and placebo were provided by Takeda Pharmaceutical Company, and moxifloxacin was provided by Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals (Whippany, NJ). Subjects were randomized to one of four sequences to receive each of the four treatments in a crossover fashion, using a Williams design. Subjects received single doses of blinded vonoprazan 40 mg (maximum therapeutic dose), vonoprazan 120 mg (supratherapeutic dose), placebo, or open‐label moxifloxacin 400 mg at the start of four treatment periods on study Days 1, 6, 11, and 16. All study drugs were administered orally. As the supratherapeutic dose of vonoprazan, a dose of 120 mg was selected and considered adequate, as patients with comorbidities may receive therapeutic dose adjustments in clinical settings. The supratherapeutic dose of vonoprazan provided at least ∼10 times higher exposure than the clinical dose (usually 20 mg or 10 mg, depending on indication) approved in Japan (Takecab Label). TAK‐438 is not expected to accumulate to any clinically relevant degree in the clinical setting.\\nPlacebo‐control and positive‐control (moxifloxacin) groups were included to meet ICH E14 requirements and to demonstrate assay sensitivity.6 A dose of 40 mg was selected as the therapeutic dose for this study because in a previous phase II study,10 40 mg was the maximum dose used and doses ≥20 mg were expected to be used for different indications. The supratherapeutic dose in this study was 120 mg because it was the highest dose administered in healthy subjects in a phase I study4 and was well tolerated. Further, the exposures observed at this dose would be above the predicted “worst‐case scenario” exposures (the expected highest exposure) determined using physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling. The 400 mg dose of moxifloxacin was selected because it is the recommended daily dose for adults in thorough QT studies.8, 16 All treatments were separated by a 4‐day washout period (Day 2 to Day 5 of each period). All study drugs were taken with 240 mL of water and subjects refrained from drinking water for at least 1 h postdose. Subjects fasted for 10 h before dosing and 4 h after dosing. The study duration, from screening to follow‐up, was a maximum of 59 days including the screening period through the follow‐up telephone call. Subjects stayed at the clinic from check‐in (Day –2) to check‐out (Day 18) of the study.\\nThe randomization schedule for this study was generated by the Takeda Global Research & Development Centre Europe (TGRD (EU)) Analytical Science Department. All randomization information was secured and housed in a locked storage area, accessible by the randomization officer at TGRD. The randomization schedule was also sent to the site so that the site pharmacist could access it. Subjects were assigned to a randomization sequence number by the order of enrollment. Equal numbers of male and female subjects were enrolled in each treatment sequence. Vonoprazan 40 mg, vonoprazan 120 mg, and placebo were administered in a double‐blind manner, and moxifloxacin 400 mg was administered open‐label.\\nStudy ECGs were acquired digitally from a 24‐h Holter recorder (H12+; Mortara Instrument, Milwaukee, WI) at baseline and on each dosing day. For baseline ECG parameters, there was 1 baseline day before Period 1, where measurements were made at the same timepoints as during a dosing day. Three 10‐s ECG recordings were extracted at predose (0 h) and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5.5, 6, 8, 12, 16, and 24 h after dosing. In addition to Holter monitoring, 12‐lead ECGs for standard assessment of safety were measured at screening, check‐in (Day –2), baseline (Day –1), and on dosing days (Days 1, 6, 11, and 16) at predose (0 h) and at 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, and 48 h after dosing. Patients were supine and at rest during ECG recording. All ECG measurements were performed at a central laboratory (Biotrial Core Lab, France) using controlled standard procedures and interpreted by a trained cardiologist. All ECG readers and technicians were blinded to study treatment, timepoints, study day, and subject identifiers (including age and sex).\\nTo determine drug concentrations in plasma, serial venous blood samples were collected into chilled vacutainers at predose (0 h) on the day of dosing and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5.5, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, and 48 h after dosing. Concentrations of vonoprazan and moxifloxacin in plasma were measured by a fully validated liquid chromatographic method with tandem mass spectrometry detection (LC‐MS/MS). The assays were validated over the vonoprazan concentration range of 0.100–100 ng/mL, and moxifloxacin concentration range of 25–5,000 ng/ml in human plasma. Pharmacokinetic parameters were derived using noncompartmental methods with WinNonlin Enterprise v. 5.2 (Pharsight, Mountain View, CA). Pharmacokinetic parameters of interest included the maximum observed concentration (Cmax), time to reach Cmax (Tmax), area under the plasma concentration–time curve (AUC) from time 0 to time of the last quantifiable concentration (AUC0‐tlqc), AUC from time 0 to infinity (AUC0‐inf), terminal elimination half‐life (T1/2), terminal elimination rate constant (λz), apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F), and apparent clearance after oral administration (CL/F). Pharmacokinetic calculations were based on actual collection times recorded during the study.\\nThe primary end point was the mean difference in the postdose, time‐matched, baseline‐adjusted QTcF between vonoprazan and placebo and between moxifloxacin and placebo (ddQTcF).\\nSecondary end points included the concentration of vonoprazan in plasma, primary pharmacokinetic variables derived from the concentrations of moxifloxacin and vonoprazan, the mean difference in the postdose, time‐matched, QT interval corrected by Bazett's formula (QTcB), QT interval corrected by individual (QTcI), and QT interval study‐specific correction (QTcss), and QT between vonoprazan and placebo and between moxifloxacin and placebo (ddQTcB, ddQTcI, ddQTcss). For each treatment, QT intervals (QTcF, QTcB, QTcI, QTcss, and QT) categorized with respect to the number and percentage of subjects having time‐matched increases >30 ms and >60 ms from baseline were recorded, as were the number and percentage of subjects having QT intervals >450 ms, >480 ms, and >500 ms, and the number and percentage of subjects with >30 ms change from baseline and >450 ms; and for each treatment heart rates, PR intervals, QRS intervals, RR intervals, and T and U wave complex morphology were also recorded.\\nSafety end points included treatment‐emergent adverse events (TEAEs), clinical laboratory parameters, vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, tympanic temperature, and body weight), and 12‐lead ECG.\\nAssuming the true difference in the largest time‐matched mean change of QTcF from baseline between vonoprazan and placebo was no more than 5 ms, 60 evaluable subjects were needed to provide 93% power to establish no QT prolongation effect (defined as the upper limit of the two‐sided 90% confidence interval (CI) for the comparison of vonoprazan vs. placebo was <10 ms) of vonoprazan. This sample size also provided at least 93% power to demonstrate assay sensitivity (defined as the lower limit of the two‐sided 90% CI for the comparison of moxifloxacin vs. placebo being greater than 5 ms for at least 1 timepoint between 1 h and 4 h postdose). This assumed that the true difference in the largest time‐matched mean change from baseline between moxifloxacin and placebo was ≥10 ms. A total of 64 subjects were planned and randomized in this study to account for potential dropouts.\\nBaseline ECG measurements were used for time‐matched baselines. QTc values were derived using four different correction methods (QTcF, QTcB, QTcI, and QTcss). QTcF was selected as the primary correction method. For QT and each QT correction method, the difference between the study drug and placebo time‐matched baseline‐adjusted QT (ddQTc) was calculated. The change from baseline in QTc interval at each timepoint (dQTc) was used as the dependent variable. This analysis was conducted using a repeated‐measures, mixed‐effects model with time, sequence, period, treatment, and time‐by‐treatment interaction as fixed effects and subjects nested within sequence as a random effect, with average baseline QTc as covariate. The analysis included the following timepoints: 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5.5, 6, 8, 12, 16, and 24 h postdose. For the primary end point, ddQTcF, no QT prolongation effect of vonoprazan was declared if the upper limit of one‐sided 95% CI at each timepoint was below 10 ms. The study assay sensitivity analysis required moxifloxacin's lower limit of one‐sided 95% CI to exceed 5 ms at 1 or more of the timepoints from 1 to 4 h postdose. There was no adjustment for multiplicity. Uncorrected and corrected QT intervals and heart rates, PR intervals, QRS intervals, and RR intervals were summarized at each timepoint for both vonoprazan doses, for moxifloxacin, and for placebo.\\nCategorical analysis of QTcF was performed to determine the number and percentage of subjects per group who had an increase from baseline at any postdose timepoint of >30 ms and >60 ms. In addition, the number and percentage of subjects per group who had a postdose QTcF of >450 ms, >480 ms, and >500 ms at any postdose timepoint were summarized.\\nFor pharmacokinetic parameters of interest, descriptive statistics (number of subjects (N), arithmetic mean, standard deviation (SD), percent coefficient of variation (%CV), median, minimum, and maximum) were used to summarize plasma vonoprazan concentrations for both doses and moxifloxacin concentrations at each scheduled timepoint.\\nA linear mixed effects model of the plasma vonoprazan concentration–QT response relationship was built, assuming random slope and intercept terms. The dependent variable was ddQTc calculated for each subject.\\nAll safety assessments were summarized by treatment group; TEAEs were coded by system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT) using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) version (M. Hayashi, H. Jenkins, D. Crawford, and R. Jenkins, Takeda Global Investigator's Brochure TAK‐438, vonoprazan fumarate). Subjects were assessed for events throughout the study, and they could report events at any time during the study. All data analyses, tables, graphs, and listings were generated using SAS v. 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). All statistical tests were two‐tailed with significance at α = 0.05 unless otherwise stated.\\nBetween January 2012 and April 2012, 92 subjects were screened. Of these 92 subjects, 64 were randomly assigned to one of the four treatment sequences and received at least one dose of the study drug (Figure 1 a). Sixty‐three subjects received all four regimens (Figure 1 b); one subject discontinued the study due to a nondrug‐related adverse event of tonsillitis following administration of moxifloxacin 400 mg in Period 1 and vonoprazan 120 mg in Period 2.\\nDemographics and other baseline characteristics were similar among the four treatment sequence groups (Table 1). The mean age of all subjects was 37.8 (SD ± 11.2 years), and mean BMI was 24.0 (SD ± 2.89) kg/m2. Male and female subjects were evenly divided (32 males and 32 females). A majority (93.8%) of the subjects were White, 4.69% were African American, and 1.56% were Asian.\\nThe time‐matched least squares (LS) mean difference in dQTcF between moxifloxacin and placebo (ddQTcF) increased at 1 h after dosing of moxifloxacin, and the lower bound of the one‐sided 95% CI of the dQTcF difference from 1.5 h to 12 h after dosing of moxifloxacin was >5 ms (Figure 2). The peak effect occurred at 4 h after dosing with moxifloxacin (12.0 ms, with a lower bound of 9.90 ms for the one‐sided 95% CI).\\nFor both vonoprazan 40 mg and 120 mg, the maximum upper bound of the one‐sided 95% CI of the difference in the means of dQTcF estimated using the linear mixed effect model from placebo (ddQTcF) was 4.9 ms, which occurred at 8 h after dosing of vonoprazan.\\nFor vonoprazan or placebo, no subject experienced an absolute QTcF value >450 ms at any postdose timepoint or had changes from baseline in QTcF >30 ms at any postdose timepoint. For moxifloxacin 400 mg, one subject had maximum QTcF >450 ms postdose, and four subjects had changes from baseline in QTcF >30 ms postdose (Table 2). Results of QTcB, QTcI, and QTcss were consistent with that of QTcF (Supplementary Table S1).\\nFor vonoprazan 40 mg and 120 mg, there was a decrease in baseline heart rate with a mean range from 2 to 6 bpm starting from 4 h postdose to 6 h postdose. No U‐waves were observed in any subject. Similar percentages of T‐wave abnormalities were observed for all treatments and were similar to baseline measurements.\\nFollowing single doses of vonoprazan 40 mg and 120 mg, the median Tmax values were reached at 2 h postdose. The mean plasma Cmax and exposure increased in more than a dose‐proportional manner (Table 3).\\nThe median plasma moxifloxacin Tmax (2.0 h) was within the 24‐h pharmacodynamic assessment period, indicating that the pharmacodynamic measurements occurred during peak plasma moxifloxacin levels.\\nAfter a 5‐day wash out, carryover was detected in 3 of the 64 subjects for TAK‐438. On each occasion, vonoprazan 120 mg had been administered in the prior period. Two of the subjects were receiving placebo and had verifiable concentrations above the limit of quantitation (LoQ). The other subject had TAK‐438 predose concentrations above the LoQ, but which were <0.3% of the Cmax of the subsequent profile (40 mg) for the subject.\\nResults from the linear model to evaluate the relationship between ddQTc and plasma vonoprazan concentration showed that there was no increase in the QTc interval with increasing concentration of vonoprazan (Table 4 ,\\xa0Figure 3). After administration of a single 40‐mg dose of vonoprazan, the model‐based estimates of ddQTcF, ddQTcB, ddQTcI, and ddQTcss at the mean plasma vonoprazan 40 mg Cmax (47.1 ng/mL) ranged from –1.10 (90% CI –2.16, –0.0454) to 0.274 (90% CI –0.781, 1.33). After administration of a single 120‐mg dose of vonoprazan, the model‐based estimates of ddQTcF, ddQTcB, ddQTcI, and ddQTcss at the mean plasma vonoprazan 120 mg Cmax (226 ng/mL) ranged from –4.49 (90% CI –6.26, –2.73) to –1.82 (90% CI –3.39, –0.246).\\nOverall, 31 of 64 subjects (48.4%) experienced ≥1 TEAE during the study (Supplementary Table S2). Similar incidences of adverse events were reported during vonoprazan 40 mg, vonoprazan 120 mg, and moxifloxacin 400 mg treatments (17.5%, 18.8%, and 18.8%, respectively). The majority of the TEAEs experienced during the study were mild (44 of 52 events); 42 of 52 events were study drug‐related. No events were considered severe, and no deaths were reported.\\nThe most common TEAEs in subjects who were administered vonoprazan 40 mg and 120 mg were headache (9.52% and 7.81%, respectively) and nausea (1.6% and 7.8%, respectively). A greater percentage of subjects had markedly abnormal QT values following moxifloxacin administration (6.25%) than with placebo (1.59%), vonoprazan 40 mg (3.17%), or vonoprazan 120 mg (3.13%). No markedly abnormal values were considered clinically significant.\\nNo findings from safety laboratory tests (serum chemistry, hematology, and liver function tests), vital signs, or urinalysis values were reported as adverse events, and no clinically significant changes from baseline were observed.\\nVonoprazan is shown to have effects on hERG channel current at the doses studied with an IC50 value of 4.8 μg/mL. Although TAK‐438 showed a statistically significant inhibitory effect on the hERG channel current at all concentrations examined (0.5, 5, and 50 μg/mL), based on a Cmax value of 59.9 ng/mL seen at the highest expected human dose (40 mg) of TAK‐438 and the percentage human plasma protein binding of TAK‐438 ranging from 85.2–88.0%, the safety margin based on free drug is calculated to be >540‐fold. The metabolites of vonoprazan are inactive and have not been tested in vitro for their inhibitory effect on hERG. A single administration of TAK‐438 at doses up to 20 mg/kg had no acute effects on the dog cardiovascular system (M. Hayashi, H. Jenkins, D. Crawford, and R. Jenkins, Takeda Global Investigator's Brochure TAK‐438, vonoprazan fumarate).\\nProlongation of cardiac repolarization, as measured by the QT interval, can potentially increase the probability of fatal cardiac arrhythmias.15 The ICH E14 guidance recommends conducting a thorough QT/QTc study for all new non‐antiarrhythmic drugs to characterize their effects on QT intervals.8, 16 As part of the clinical development program, this phase I, randomized, single‐center, 4‐period, 4‐sequence, crossover study was designed to examine the effect of therapeutic and supratherapeutic doses of vonoprazan, a novel orally active P‐CAB, on the QT/QTc interval in healthy male and female subjects by analyzing the mean difference in the postdose, time‐matched, baseline‐adjusted QTcF between vonoprazan and placebo and between moxifloxacin and placebo. To prevent reader bias and to maintain consistency in QT measurement, the ICH E14 guidance states that ECGs should be read in a central laboratory by a small group of trained readers blinded to both treatment and patient identity.8 In the present study, continuous Holter ECG recordings were performed for 24 h at baseline and following each treatment regimen. ECGs were extracted at scheduled pharmacokinetic timepoints for blinded review by a trained cardiologist at the central laboratory. The maximum upper bound of the one‐sided 95% CI for ddQTcF for TAK‐438 40 and 120 mg were below the threshold of regulatory concern of 10 ms.8 The findings from this study demonstrate that, in healthy subjects, vonoprazan did not cause concern about QTc prolongation according to the ICH E 14 criteria, and was well tolerated.\\nIn accordance with the ICH E14 guidelines, a positive control was used in this study to verify the assay sensitivity. This study included moxifloxacin 400 mg administered as a single dose at one of the four periods to each subject open‐label. Assay sensitivity was established in this study because the lower bound of the one‐sided 95% CI for ddQTcF was >5 ms between 1.5 and 12 h postdose. Therefore, QT data for vonoprazan could be interpreted, and following 40 mg and 120 mg doses of vonoprazan, the maximum upper bound of the one‐sided 95% CI for ddQTcF was 4.9 ms. This is less than the threshold of concern when the maximum upper bound of the one‐sided 95% CI for ddQTcF is >10 ms.\\nSince the QT interval shortens with increasing heart rate, QT correction methods are used.17 In this study, QT interval correction methods that were used included QTcF, QTcB, QTcss, and QTcI. An assessment of the QT correction methods using Spearman correlation coefficients indicated that the most appropriate intervals for assessment were QTcF, QTcI, and QTcss. Assessment and correction of QT/QTc by multiple correction methods confirmed that vonoprazan did not significantly prolong the QT/QTc in healthy subjects. There were no subjects with a QTcF interval >450 ms or an increase from baseline >30 ms after administration of vonoprazan.\\nFor vonoprazan 40 mg and 120 mg, there was a small decrease from baseline in heart rate with a mean range of 2 to 6 bpm between 4 h and 6 h postdose. This decrease was considered not clinically significant and was not expected to confound heart‐rate correction of QT values. No clinically significant U‐waves or T‐waves were observed in any subject. In addition, no cardiac adverse events were reported. The results obtained from ECG recordings in this study are consistent with a lack of clinically meaningful changes for any ECG parameters observed during previous clinical studies of vonoprazan to date.4, 5, 9 In addition, an analysis of dQTcF data from earlier phase I single rising dose PK studies (data on file) showed no statistical evidence of QT prolongation, with the rate of change of dQTcF per unit of concentration of TAK‐438 of –0.023 (ms/ng/mL) (95% CI –0.65, 0.19).\\nSimilar to data from previous studies,4, 5 plasma concentrations of vonoprazan increased in a slightly more than dose‐proportional manner. Thorough QT studies should ensure that dose–response and concentration–response relationships for QTc prolongation are fully characterized, including exploration of concentrations higher than those anticipated in therapeutic use. In this study, there was no evidence of QT/QTc prolongation or arrhythmogenic effects with maximum clinical and supratherapeutic doses of vonoprazan, and results from the linear model to evaluate the relationship between ddQTc and plasma vonoprazan concentration showed that there was no increase in the QTc interval with increasing concentration of vonoprazan.\\nThe safety profile of vonoprazan in this study was consistent with previous studies of vonoprazan in healthy subjects.4, 5, 9 Single doses of vonoprazan at 40 mg and 120 mg were well tolerated and most adverse events were considered mild or moderate in intensity. No deaths or serious adverse events were reported during the study. No abnormal laboratory values were reported. Hepatic laboratory values were within normal limits.\\nA potential limitation of this study is that the study was conducted in healthy volunteers, rather than the target population. Another limitation is that the current study evaluated the effects on the QT interval after only a single dose of vonoprazan, while the recommended oral dose of vonoprazan is 10 mg or 20 mg once daily for 4 weeks to 8 weeks, depending on the indication.3 However, in a phase I study of vonoprazan 10 mg to 40 mg once daily for 7 consecutive days in healthy Japanese males (N = 60), there was no clinically relevant accumulation of vonoprazan or its metabolites with similar pharmacokinetic parameters on Days 1 and 7.5 Although the long‐term effects of vonoprazan on QT/QTc in patients cannot be determined from the current study, long‐term clinical studies with vonoprazan lasting up to 2 years have not identified clinically meaningful changes in serum electrolyte levels or ECG parameters (unpublished data; OCT‐301, Mizokami Y, Oda K, Funao N, Nishimura A, Soen S, Kawai T, Ashida K, et\\xa0al.; and OCT‐302, Kawai T, Oda K, Funao N, Nishimura A, Matsumoto Y, Mizokami Y, Ashida K, et al.)\\nThe results of this study are strengthened by its randomized, 4‐period, 4‐sequence, placebo‐ and active‐controlled crossover study design outlined in the ICH E14 guidelines for the evaluation of the QT/QTc interval with non‐antiarrhythmic drugs. Assay sensitivity was established in the study by the use of moxifloxacin as a positive control to detect clinically significant changes from baseline in QT/QTc. The present study utilized a supratherapeutic dose of vonoprazan in addition to a potential maximum therapeutic dose. Given that there was no increase in the QTc interval at the supratherapeutic dose, it can be expected that there will not be an effect of vonoprazan on the QTc interval at the dose targeted for clinical use.\\nIn conclusion, this study met the requirements of a negative QT/QTc study and further supports the assertion that there is a limited likelihood that a clinically meaningful QT prolongation would occur in a clinical setting during treatment with vonoprazan.\"},\n",

       "    'fulltext': 'Core tip: Because the Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication rate of conventional proton pump inhibitor (PPI)-based treatment has decreased because clarithromycin-resistant strains have appeared in recent years, a new treatment strategy is required. Vonoprazan is a novel potassium -competitive acid blocker that has strong, long-lasting effects, but few studies have investigated its efficacy against H. pylori. We compared vonoprazan-based therapy and PPI-based therapy as first-line and second-line treatments. Vonoprazan-based therapy was superior to PPI-based therapy, particularly for smokers, but adverse events (AEs) due to vonoprazan occurred more frequently. Vonoprazan-based therapy is a potentially efficacious treatment, but it should be used with caution due to possible AEs.\\nHelicobacter pylori (H. pylori) contributes to upper gastrointestinal diseases, such as chronic gastritis, peptic ulcers, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma, and gastric cancer. Proton pump inhibitor (PPI)-based H. pylori eradication therapy has been shown to be effective for treatment of H. pylori-related diseases.\\nIn Japan, the first-line regimen consists of triple therapy with a PPI (omeprazole, rabeprazole, lansoprazole, or esomeprazole), amoxicillin (AMPC), and clarithromycin (CAM) for 7 d. As of 2000, the cost of this therapy for patients with gastric or duodenal ulcers has been covered under Japan’s national health insurance. After the approval of the first regimen, the second-line treatment, in which CAM is replaced by metronidazole (MNZ), was also approved in 2007. Dating from February 2013, H. pylori eradication therapy was expanded to include patients with H. pylori infection-associated gastritis to prevent gastric cancer.\\nHowever, the eradication rate with the first-line treatment has reportedly decreased due to the increase of CAM-resistant strains in recent years. Therefore, a more effective strategy is required for CAM-resistant patients.\\nVonoprazan is a novel potassium-competitive acid blocker (P-CAB) and to a new class of gastric acid-suppressive agents. P-CABs, which block H+, K+ ATPase in a competitive and reversible manner, result in stronger and more sustained acid suppression than PPIs. Alteration of the intragastric pH, to a higher pH with a lower percentage of time spent < pH 4, is crucial in H. pylori eradication therapy. Therefore, P-CAB-based triple therapy should be more efficient than PPI-based therapy for H. pylori-infected patients, including CAM-resistant patients. A phase III randomized, double-blind study showed that vonoprazan (P-CAB)-based treatment was effective in both first- and second-line H. pylori eradication therapy compared to treatment with lansoprazol.\\nIn this study, we evaluated the clinical effectiveness and safety of vonoprazan-based H. pylori eradication therapy and compared it to that of conventional PPI-based therapy in clinical practice.\\nThis study was conducted in a single institution (Hattori Clinic). We retrospectively examined data from patients administered first- and/or second-line eradication therapy.\\nH. pylori-positive patients diagnosed via a high-resolution endoscope (GIF260, 290 series; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) with gastric ulcer and/or ulcer scar (GU/GUs), duodenal ulcer and/or ulcer scar (DU/DUs), gastroduodenal ulcer and/or ulcer scar (GDU/GDUs), gastric MALT lymphoma, post-endoscopic submucosal dissection (post ESD) for early gastric cancer or atrophic gastritis from April 2014 to December 2015 at Hattori Clinic were enrolled in this study.\\nThe exclusion criteria were as follows: less than 20 years of age; past history of total gastrectomy; history of drug allergy to PPIs, AMPC, CAM, or MNZ; clinically significant disease (hepatic, renal or cardiac disease); and pregnancy.\\nThe presence of H. pylori at admission and after first- and second-line eradication therapy was confirmed with the 13C-urea breath test (UBT). The cut-off value was 2.5‰. Confirmation of eradication by UBT was performed no less than 8 wk after eradication treatment was completed. UBT-negative patients whose endoscopic findings showed gastric atrophy received an additional stool antigen test.\\nH. pylori-positive patients received one of the following first-line treatments: (1) vonoprazan (VPZ) group; 20 mg vonoprazan, 200 mg CAM, and 750 mg AMPC twice daily for 7 d; (2) esomeprazole (EPZ) group; 20 mg esomeprazole, 200 mg CAM, and 750 mg AMPC twice daily for 7 d; (3) rabeprazole (RPZ) group; 10 mg rabeprazole, 200 mg CAM, and 750 mg AMPC twice daily for 7 d; (4) lansoprazole (LPZ) group; 30 mg lansoprazole, 200 mg CAM, and 750 mg AMPC twice daily for 7 d. For the second-line treatment, 200 mg CAM was replaced with 250 mg MNZ and a selected acid blocker medication depended on the attending doctor’s discretion.\\nAdverse events (AEs) were defined as undesirable medical symptoms or conditions after the beginning of the treatment, which were interrogated directly by each investigator.\\nThe primary endpoint was eradication rate. The secondary endpoints were AEs and related factors.\\nSubgroup analyses of demographic and clinical characteristics, including presence of endoscopic gastric atrophy, age, gender, alcohol consumption, body mass index (BMI), and smoking, were also conducted. The Kimura-Takemoto classification was used to classify atrophic gastritis.\\nThis study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and the research protocol was approved by the institutional review board of the Hattori Clinic.\\nThe eradication rate was evaluated with a full analysis set (FAS) and calculated with 95%CI. In the FAS analysis, patients who were lost during follow-up and who did not comply with the protocol were excluded.\\nStatistical analysis of eradication rate among the four regimens was assessed using the χ2 test. Patient characteristics among the four groups were assessed via Fisher’s exact test and the χ2 test. Factors associated with treatment failure were assessed by logistic regression analysis. P values < 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.\\nIn total, 1353 patients completed the first-line treatment protocol. The baseline characteristics and demographics of patients in this study were presented in Table 1. Most patients (n = 1169) were diagnosed with H. pylori-infected gastritis without any other lesions or diseases. Others diagnoses were GU/GUs (n = 65), DU/DUs (n = 105), GDU/GDUs (n = 8), MALT lymphoma (n = 2), and post ESD for early gastric cancer (n = 4). The patients were treated with VPZ (n = 546), EPZ (n = 507), RPZ (n = 89), or LPZ (n = 211). Demographic and other baseline characteristics for all the patients receiving the four regimens were not significantly different with regard to age, sex, and upper gastrointestinal diseases. In total, 261 patients completed the second-line treatment protocol. Demographic and other baseline characteristics in the second-line treatment were also shown in Table 1 and there were not significant differences in all of them.\\nFAS analysis indicated that the first-line treatment eradication rate was 87.9% (95%CI: 84.9%-90.5%) in the VPZ group, 71.6% (95%CI: 67.5%-75.5%) in the EPZ group, 62.9% (95%CI: 52.0%-72.9%) in the RPZ group, and 57.3% (95%CI: 50.4%-64.1%) in the LPZ group (Figure 1). The eradication rate achieved in the VPZ group was significantly higher than that in the other three groups ( Table 2).\\nThe eradication rates for the second-line treatment were 96.1% (95%CI: 88.9%-99.2%) in the VPZ group, 88.5% (95%CI: 80.7%-93.9%) in the EPZ group, 95.8% (95%CI: 78.9%-99.9%) in the RPZ group, and 89.5% (95%CI: 78.5%-96.0%) in the LPZ group (Figure 2), and there were no significant differences among the four groups.\\nWe evaluated age, extent of atrophic gastritis, sex, BMI, alcohol abuse, and smoking habits as predictive factors for successful H. pylori eradication in the first- and second-line treatments among the four groups. For the first-line treatment, smoking alone showed a significant difference between the four groups by univariate analyses. Thus, smoking habits decreased H. pylori eradication rates in the three PPI groups, whereas eradication was unaffected in the VPZ group (Table 2). There were no predictive factors observed for second-line treatment and there were no predictive factors demonstrated in both the first-line treatment and the second-line treatment by multivariate analyses (data not shown).\\nThe AE incidence during first-line eradication therapy was 11.2% in the VPZ group compared with 7.7% in the EPZ group, 10.1% in the RPZ group, and 5.7% in the LPZ group. The most frequently observed AE was diarrhoea/soft stool. There was no significant difference in AE incidence between the VPZ group and the PPI groups (P = 0.054). However, the VPZ group showed a wider range of AEs including appetite loss, headache, fever and haematuria. The AE incidence for second-line eradication therapy was also not significantly different, and diarrhoea/soft stool occurred most frequently, similar to first-line eradication therapy (Table 3). None of the patients showed serious and critical AEs in during either the first or second-line therapy and none of the patients discontinued H. pylori eradication treatment because of AEs.\\nWe compared the efficacies and safety profiles of vonoprazan and three PPIs (esomeprazole, rabeprazole, and lansoprazole) used for H. pylori eradication and found vonoprazan to be superior to PPIs as a first-line therapy (P < 0.01).\\nSeveral factors, such as cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) polymorphisms, antibiotic susceptibility, smoking habits, and patient compliance, are known to cause H. pylori eradication failure. Insufficient gastric acid inhibition and H. pylori antibiotic resistance are major factors underlying H. pylori eradication failure.\\nH. pylori eradication is dependent on the maintenance of a near neutral gastric pH throughout the day. Maintenance of a gastric pH > 5 is necessary for H. pylori to replicate. Additionally, acid suppression has been reported to enhance antibiotic stability and bacterial sensitivity. Therefore, adequate acid suppression is essential for H. pylori eradication therapy.\\nVonoprazan is a highly effective anti-acid drug compared to PPIs. Sakurai et al showed that vonoprazan suppressed acid secretion more rapidly and persistently than two PPIs, esomeprazole and rabeprazole. The authors showed that even on the first day of administration, the mean pH for vonoprazan was above 5, in contrast to the pH induced by PPIs, and the 24 h pH 4 holding-time (acid-inhibitory effect) of vonoprazan greatly exceeded that of the PPIs. Considering the significance of acid suppression for H. pylori eradication therapy, vonoprazan could be effective for resolving H. pylori eradication failure.\\nThe acid-inhibitory effect of PPIs is affected by CYP2C19 polymorphisms, and for extensive CYP2C19 metabolizers, the acid-inhibitory effect of PPIs is decreased. The population frequency of poor, intermediate, extensive metabolizers in Japan is 18.8%, 43.8% and 35.5%, respectively.\\nEsomeprazole is less susceptible to CYP2C19 polymorphisms. Indeed, the eradication rate of esomeprazole was significantly higher than that of lansoprazole in our study. We suggest that the eradication rates observed in our results correspond to the population frequency of genetic polymorphisms affecting the metabolism of the PPI. Vonoprazan is also unaffected by CYP2C19 polymorphisms because it is poorly metabolized by CYP2C19.\\nWe hypothesized that the significantly higher eradication rate for vonoprazan compared to the other PPIs was caused by tolerance of CYP2C19 polymorphisms.\\nDrug interactions with antibiotics may also affect eradication rate. Comparing the pharmacokinetics of co-administration of vonoprazan, CAM plus AMPC and single administration of the drugs, co-administered vonoprazan and CAM resulted in a higher mean Cmax and area under the curve (AUC) compared with those of single administration. However, AMPC had no effect on Cmax and AUC. Both CAM and vonoprazan are predominantly metabolized by CYP3A4 and have also been reported to be possible CYP3A4 inhibitors when used in combination. Thus, vonoprazan and CAM might mutually inhibit their metabolism, increasing the plasma concentrations of both CAM and vonoprazan. A phase III, randomized, double-blind, multicentre study on vonoprazan showed higher eradication rates with vonoprazan (82.0%) against CAM resistance compared to that of lansoprazole (40.0%); thus, we hypothesize that these pharmacological characteristics of vonoprazan will be advantageous for H. pylori-eradication therapy.\\nAlthough vonoprazan might be effective in H. pylori eradication therapy, AEs are still possible with this new drug. However, in our study, there was no significant difference in the incidence of AEs between vonoprazan and PPIs (P = 0.054). Notably, vonoprazan caused a wider variety of AEs compared to PPIs, although every AE was relatively mild and completely resolved after discontinuation of H. pylori eradication therapy. As we mentioned above, the plasma concentrations of CAM and vonoprazan might be increased during first-line treatment, making it likely that unexpected and more frequent AEs happen. Thus, vonoprazan-associated AEs need to be carefully monitored in the future.\\nA phase III study also showed an extremely high eradication rate (98%) for second-line triple therapy with vonoprazan, AMPC, and MNZ. Correspondingly, our second-line eradication rate was 96.1% overall, and there were no significant differences in the second-line eradication rates and AEs between the three PPIs and vonoprazan. In the second-line treatment, CAM was replaced by MNZ, which is believed to be unaffected by CYP3A and CYP2C19 polymorphisms. Due to the original high eradication rates of second-line therapy with PPIs, addition of MNZ did not result in differences in the second-line eradication rates.\\nTobacco smoking was also demonstrated to be a factor in H. pylori eradication failure; this is because smoking stimulates acid secretion, affects the metabolism of cytochrome P450, and decreases gastric blood flow and mucous secretion. Hence, smoking reduces the delivery of antibiotics to the gastric mucosa. Most significantly, smoking stimulates acid secretion, which results in decreased intragastric pH. Indeed, Suzuki et al reported that smoking increased the risk of H. pylori eradication failure. Interestingly, H. pylori eradication rates among patients in the VPZ group who smoked were unaffected in our study, whereas the eradication rates in the PPI groups decreased significantly. Thus, H. pylori therapy with vonoprazan was effective even for smoking patients; this was most likely because of strong acid suppression. Although smoking alone showed a significant difference between the four groups by univariate analyses, it was not a significant factor by multivariate analyses. We believe that this result might have arisen because we did not investigate drug sensitivity, and H. pylori resistance to CAM might be a major reason for treatment failure. It is necessary to investigate factors contributing to the success of H. pylori eradication treatment, including drug sensitivity, in the future.\\nThis study was limited because it was retrospective and only performed at a single centre; moreover, we did not investigate drug sensitivity and CYP2C19 polymorphism. Triple therapy combining a PPI with AMPC and CAM generates an unacceptably low eradication rate in most of the world. Sequential therapy, quadruple therapy, concomitant therapy and high dose dual therapy are recommended in the era of increased CAM resistance. However, although the resistance of H. pylori to CAM is increasing in Japan, only triple therapy with PPI, AMPC and CAM has been recognized under Japan’s national health insurance. Vonoprazan-based triple therapy has been available in Japan dating from February 2015. In our results, the vonoprazan eradication rate was high (87.9%), but it is not a satisfactory result regarding the efficacy of H. pylori eradication throughout the world. If vonoprazan -based triple therapy was provided to CAM -sensitive patients, the eradication rate might increase to over 90%. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate drug sensitivity before treatment in Japan. If the patients have CAM-resistant strains of H. pylori, they will require regimens of vonoprazan and different types and doses of antibiotics as well as different periods instead of CAM.\\nH. pylori eradication therapy is an effective treatment to help prevent gastric cancer. However, indiscriminate use of H. pylori eradication therapy might result in the expansion of antibiotic resistance instead of promoting gastric cancer prevention. Therefore, we need to select appropriate H. pylori eradication regimens by taking into consideration individual variations, such as antibiotic resistance and CYP2C19 polymorphism; however, the cost of these tests is not covered under Japan’s national health insurance scheme.\\nIn conclusion, triple therapy with vonoprazan, AMPC, and CAM is superior to PPI-based therapy for first-line eradication, however possible AEs should be monitored.\\nHelicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication therapy is an effective treatment to help prevent gastric cancer. Triple therapy combining a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) with amoxicillin (AMPC), and clarithromycin (CAM) for H. pylori eradication is standard first-line therapy in Japan. However, the H. pylori eradication rate has decreased due to the increased prevalence of CAM resistance, thus a more effective strategy is required. Vonoprazan is a novel potassium -competitive acid blocker that has strong, long-lasting effects, but few studies have investigated its efficacy against H. pylori thus far. In this study, we retrospectively examined the effectiveness and safety of vonoprazan-based therapy compared with PPI-based therapies to treat H. pylori.\\nTriple therapy combining a PPI with AMPC and CAM provides unacceptably low eradication rates in most regions of the world. A good H. pylori therapy regimen with an eradication rate above 90% is needed. A more effective regimen is necessary in Japan.\\nIn this study, vonoprazan resulted in a significantly higher eradication rate (87.9%) than that of the three PPIs in the first-line treatment. There were no significant differences in the second-line eradication rates. Interestingly, H. pylori eradication rate for vonoprazan in smoking patients was similar to that of non-smoking patients, whereas the eradication rates with PPIs for smokers were decreased.\\nIt is necessary to investigate drug sensitivity before treatment because H. pylori CAM resistance is increasing in Japan. If the patients have CAM-resistant strains of H. pylori, treatment will require regimens of vonoprazan and different types and doses of antibiotics. Vonoprazan-containing triple therapy, quadruple therapy, sequential therapy and dual therapy that considers drug sensitivity will produce an excellent eradication rate.\\nThis manuscript is the retrospective study of Helicobacter pylori eradication using vonoprazan and conventional PPIs.'}]}}"
