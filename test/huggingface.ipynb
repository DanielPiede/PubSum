    "text1 = \"\"\"Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) is a heterogeneous group of chronic inflammatory disorders that mainly affects the gastrointestinal tract, of which the principal phenotypes are Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Several biological treatment options are available. Tumour necrosis factor-α inhibitors (TNFis), such as infliximab and adalimumab, were the first class of biological agents approved for the treatment of patients with IBD and are highly effective against luminal and extra-intestinal manifestations of the disease. Anti-integrin agents (e.g., vedolizumab and natalizumab—only in the United States) are the second class of biological agents that have proven effective in both IBD entities.\n",
    "Treatment guidelines for CD recommend TNFis for patients who have not responded to conventional therapy (e.g., steroids and/or thiopurines), whereas vedolizumab and ustekinumab, anti-interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-23, are recommended for patients who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy and/or TNFis. The use of TNFi therapy early in the disease course (in the first 2 years) may be more effective in CD and could be particularly beneficial in patients with poor prognostic factors (e.g., in patients with fistulising perianal disease). Guidelines for UC recommend treatment escalation with thiopurines, TNFi therapy, vedolizumab, ustekinumab or tofacitinib for patients receiving high dose mesalazine maintenance therapy who become corticosteroid dependent or refractory. In the case of TNFi treatment failure, second-line therapy with vedolizumab, ustekinumab or tofacitinib should be considered. US guidelines are broadly aligned with European guidelines with respect to appropriate biological therapies for patients with moderate-to-severe IBD.\n",
    "Guidelines recommend that the choice of first-line biological agent should be determined by clinical factors, cost, safety, availability of local infusion capacity, as well as patient preference and likely adherence; however, there is limited evidence regarding the comparative efficacy and safety of these agents for the treatment of these patient populations. No head-to-head RCTs have compared infliximab and vedolizumab for the treatment of patients with IBD, and comparative data from real-world studies are difficult to contextualise in the absence of mutually supplementary RCTs.\n",
    "Several systematic reviews have synthesised data for multiple biological agents (including infliximab and vedolizumab) in IBD to draw preliminary conclusions; however, one did not evaluate the relative safety of infliximab and vedolizumab, and the other covered only the induction phase in patients with UC. Furthermore, existing systematic reviews do not include data from more recent pivotal trials (e.g., of subcutaneous [SC] infliximab). Therefore, to our knowledge, we have conducted the first systematic review and meta-analysis to comprehensively evaluate the comparative efficacy and safety of infliximab and vedolizumab in adult patients with moderate-to-severe CD or UC.\n",
    "The current systematic review was performed using a pre-established protocol. (PROSPERO number: CRD42021177954).\n",
    "We performed systematic electronic searches of PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane Library (comprising the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the Health Technology Assessment database). Search strategies were developed using Medical Subject Headings and free-text terms (Supplementary materials). All searches were performed for the period of 1 January 2010 through 30 April 2021 to ensure the inclusion of recently published data.\n",
    "Parallel-group RCTs were included for the analysis.\n",
    "Two cohorts of patients (analysed separately) were included: adults (aged ≥ 18 years) with moderate-to-severe CD or adults (aged ≥ 18 years) with moderate-to-severe UC. Patients with unspecified disease severity or those who had undergone intestinal surgery were excluded.\n",
    "We included trials that evaluated infliximab (reference product or biosimilar) or vedolizumab. Dosing regimens were required to align with the summary of product characteristics (SmPC) for approved drugs, or with the SmPC of the originator product for unapproved biosimilars.\n",
    "Studies that reported one or more of the following outcomes at Week 6 (induction phase) and/or at 1 year (Weeks 50–54; maintenance phase) were included. Efficacy outcomes for CD included the proportion of patients achieving a Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (CDAI)-70 response, defined as a 70 ≥ points decrease from the baseline value, proportion of patients achieving a CDAI-100 response (a decrease in CDAI score of ≥ 100 points from the baseline value) and proportion of patients achieving clinical remission (an absolute CDAI score of < 150 points). Efficacy outcomes for UC included the proportion of patients achieving clinical response (defined as a decrease from baseline in total Mayo score of ≥ 3 points and ≥ 30%, with an accompanying decrease in rectal bleeding subscore of ≥ 1 point or an absolute rectal bleeding subscore of 0 or 1), proportion of patients achieving clinical remission (a total Mayo score of ≤ 2 points with no individual subscore exceeding 1 point) and proportion of patients achieving mucosal healing (an absolute endoscopic subscore of 0 or 1 per the Mayo Scoring System). Safety outcomes (CD and UC) included the proportions of patients experiencing any adverse event (AE), serious adverse event (SAE), any infection or serious infection, and the proportion who discontinued due to AEs or lack of efficacy that are evaluated at any point of time in a year.\n",
    "Two investigators (HGB, MJ) independently screened the titles and abstracts of the retrieved records (per eligibility criteria in Sect. 2.2) to exclude studies that are irrelevant to the research question. A third reviewer (Taek Sang Kwon, Celltrion Healthcare) mediated in the points of disagreement. The third reviewer randomly selected sample of excluded studies to validate appropriate application of the exclusion criteria.\n",
    "Full-text articles of studies identified as potentially relevant for inclusion during title and abstract screening were reviewed independently by two authors HGB and MJ to determine inclusion (recording reasons), and the third reviewer arbitrated in the case of disagreement. Multiple reports of the same study were collected so that studies were the unit of interest for the review. The screening and full-text review process was thoroughly documented to complete a Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) flow diagram.\n",
    "Study characteristics and outcome data were extracted from the included studies and recorded using a Microsoft Excel template (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA, USA). The following study characteristics were extracted: design (study duration, randomisation method, blinding), population (demographics, baseline disease activity, number of randomised participants, prior TNFi use, concomitant medication), interventions (type, dose, regimen), and prespecified outcome measures (see above 2.2.4; Additional file 1: Table 1).\n",
    "Data for each prespecified outcome of interest were pooled in two separate analyses for patients with CD or UC, respectively. Outcomes reported as proportions (n: event; N: population) were analysed, and the overall proportions from each study were combined using a random-effects meta-analysis. A meta-analysis was only performed if studies were deemed to have similar characteristics (e.g., study populations and treatments). The I2 statistic was used to evaluate heterogeneity among the trials included in each meta-analysis. All statistical analyses were performed using R (version 4.0.2).\n",
    "Risk of bias and generalisability for the included studies were evaluated according to criteria defined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. The following domains were utilised in order to assess the risk of bias: random sequence generation; allocation concealment; blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment; incomplete outcome data; selective outcome reporting; and other bias. Each potential source of bias was rated as high, low, or unclear. Assessments were completed by an author (HGB) responsible for data extraction and checked by a second author (MJ).\n",
    "Infliximab (four studies): NCT00094458 (SONIC), NCT02096861 (PLANET CD), NCT02148640 (NOR-SWITCH), NCT02883452 (CT-P13 SC trial).\n",
    "Vedolizumab (two studies): NCT00783692 (GEMINI 2), NCT01224171 (GEMINI 3).\n",
    "The selection of studies for inclusion is summarised in a PRISMA flow diagram to illustrate the flow of information for studies enrolling patients with CD (Fig. 1A). We identified 2,661 records through the searches. After removal of duplicates, 2,019 records were screened (1,855 records excluded) and 164 full-text articles were assessed against the eligibility criteria (150 articles excluded). Six studies (reported in 13 articles) were included in the qualitative synthesis and in the quantitative synthesis, as follows:\n",
    "Infliximab (four studies): NCT00036439 (ACT1), NCT00096655 (ACT2), NCT02148640 (NOR-SWITCH), NCT02883452 (CT-P13 SC trial).\n",
    "Vedolizumab (three studies): NCT00783718 (GEMINI 1), NCT02497469 (VARSITY), NCT02611830 (VISIBLE 1).\n",
    "A PRISMA flow diagram summarising the flow of information for studies enrolling patients with UC is presented in Fig. 1B. We identified 1,959 records through the electronic searches and one record from another source. Specifically, as data for ACT 1 and 2 study by Adedokun et al. (2018) was not utilizable in our analysis because the article did not evaluate the prespecified timeframe and outcomes of our interest. The current review evaluated ACT 1 and 2 data as more data were needed for UC in order to perform meta-analyses in some outcomes (Fig. 2A, Additional file 1: Figs. 11, 12, 18), largely accounting for the fact that infliximab had few available RCT data for the past decade. Thus, we instead have taken data from the reference list of the article as an exception. After removal of duplicates, 1,138 records were screened (894 articles excluded) and 244 full-text articles were assessed against the eligibility criteria (232 articles excluded). Seven studies (reported in 12 articles) were included in the qualitative synthesis and quantitative analyses, as follows:\n",
    "The design and eligibility criteria of the six studies that contributed data to the CD analyses were generally consistent (Additional file 1: Table 1). All six studies were randomised trials with a duration of ≥ 50 weeks: five studies included a double-blind period, and one study was conducted using an open-label design (CT-P13 SC trial). Two of the six studies included an open-label extension (NOR-SWITCH and GEMINI 3) and three studies (PLANET CD, NOR-SWITCH and CT-P13) included switching phases wherein participants switched between infliximab products. Five of six studies were multinational, whereas one study was conducted in Norway (NOR-SWITCH).\n",
    "Across studies, inclusion criteria required participants to be adults (aged ≥ 18) with a diagnosis of CD; four of six studies required participants to have a CDAI score of 220–450, one study (GEMINI 3) specified 220–400 and another (NOR-SWITCH) did not specify a CDAI score. Prior TNFi use was not permitted in three studies (SONIC, PLANET CD, CT-P13 SC trial), stable treatment with infliximab for ≥ 6 months was an inclusion criterion in NOR-SWITCH, and treatment failure with corticosteroids, immunosuppressive agents or TNFis was an inclusion criterion for GEMINI 2 and GEMINI 3 (within the past 5 years).\n",
    "All studies included a treatment arm of either infliximab or vedolizumab. An intravenous formulation of infliximab or vedolizumab was initially administered at Weeks 0, 2, and 6 for induction and every 8 weeks (Q8W) thereafter while a subcutaneous formulation of infliximab was initially administered at Weeks 0 and 2 for induction and every 2 weeks (Q2W) from Week 6.\n",
    "A total of 2,020 participants were initially randomised/assigned to relevant treatment arms of the selected studies. The mean/median age ranged from 32.0 to 39.5 years, 39% to 56% of participants were female, mean/median body weight ranged from 66.1 to 72.0 kg (where reported) and mean/median disease duration ranged from 2.2 to 14.3 years (Additional file 1: Table 2).\n",
    "The design and eligibility criteria of the seven studies that contributed data to the UC analyses were generally consistent (Additional file 1: Table 1). All seven studies were randomised trials with a duration of ≥ 46 weeks, except for ACT2 (22 weeks): six studies included double-blind periods and one study was open-label (CT-P13 SC trial). Two studies included an open-label extension (NOR-SWITCH and VISIBLE 1). Three studies included switching phases wherein participants switched between infliximab products (NOR-SWITCH and CT-P13 SC trial) or between IV and SC vedolizumab (VISIBLE 1). Six of the seven studies were multinational, whereas one study (NOR-SWITCH) was conducted in Norway.\n",
    "Across studies, inclusion criteria required participants to be adults (aged ≥ 18 years) with active UC (Mayo score 6–12 and endoscopic sub-score ≥ 2) despite treatment with conventional therapies (e.g., corticosteroids, azathioprine or mercaptopurine). Prior TNFi treatment was not permitted in four studies (ACT 1, ACT 2, CT-P13 SC trial and VARSITY), stable treatment with infliximab for ≥ 6 months was an inclusion criterion in NOR-SWITCH and use of TNFi and biological agents were not permitted within 60 days before study initiation in GEMINI 1 and VISIBLE 1, respectively.\n",
    "Four of the seven studies evaluated infliximab (ACT 1, ACT 2, NOR-SWITCH and CT-P13 SC trial) and three evaluated vedolizumab (GEMINI 1, VISIBLE 1 and VARSITY). All of the infliximab studies included a treatment arm wherein infliximab was administered at Weeks 0, 2 and 6 (induction) and Q8W thereafter (maintenance) except for the CT-P13 SC trial. The CT-P13 SC trial included evaluation of subcutaneous infliximab Q2W from Week 6 following IV induction at Weeks 0 and 2 (see Sect. 3.2.1). All of the vedolizumab studies included a treatment arm wherein IV vedolizumab was administered at Weeks 0, 2, and 6 and Q8W thereafter except for one study that included a treatment arm wherein IV vedolizumab was administered at Weeks 0 and 2 for induction, followed by SC vedolizumab Q2W from Week 6.\n",
    "A total of 1,999 participants were initially randomised to relevant treatment arms of the included studies. The mean/median age ranged from 33.0 to 45.8 years, 30% to 46% of participants were female, mean/median body weight ranged from 66.1 to 80.0 kg (where reported) and mean/median disease duration ranged from 5.7 to 11.5 years (Additional file 1: Table 3).\n",
    "A summary of the risk-of-bias assessment for studies contributing to the CD analyses is presented in Fig. 3A. Across 42 assessments (six studies and seven risk-of-bias domains), 29 were considered to be at low risk of bias, 10 at high risk and three to have an unclear risk of bias. All six studies had low risk of bias for random sequence generation and selective reporting. NOR-SWITCH was the only study considered at low or unclear risk of bias for all domains. Most studies (five out of six) had one or more domains considered to be at high risk, and the CT-P13 SC and GEMINI 2 trials were at high risk of bias for three and four domains, respectively. The CT-P13 SC study was considered to be at high risk of bias due to the nature of an open-label trial and the results were combined as inflammatory bowel disease, not categorized into CD and UC. GEMINI 2, NOR-SWITCH, and PLANET CD were considered to be at high risk of ‘other bias’ because of the selective inclusion of induction responders in the maintenance phase; notably, this high risk of bias applies only to the maintenance-phase data for these studies as the induction phase included all enrolled patients.\n",
    "Figure 3B presents a summary of the risk-of-bias assessment for studies contributing to the UC analyses. Across 49 assessments (seven studies and seven risk-of-bias domains), 36 were considered to be at low risk of bias, nine at high risk and four to have an unclear risk of bias. All seven studies were considered to be at low risk of bias for random sequence generation and selective reporting. Four studies were considered at low or unclear risk of bias for all domains (VARSITY, ACT 1, ACT 2, NOR-SWITCH). Three studies had three domains considered to be at high risk of bias (GEMINI 1, VISIBLE 1, CT-P13 SC trial). The results from CT-P13 SC trial have the same risk of bias as CD such as having an open-label study design and did not fully categorised the safety outcomes. GEMINI 1 and VISIBLE 1 were considered to be at high risk of ‘other bias’ because of the selective inclusion of induction responders in the maintenance phase; again, this high risk of bias applies only to the maintenance-phase data for these studies as the induction phase included all enrolled patients.\n",
    "A summary of findings for the meta-analyses for infliximab and vedolizumab in patients with CD is presented in Table 1. For most efficacy outcomes during the induction and maintenance phases, infliximab yielded better efficacy than vedolizumab, with non-overlapping 95% confidence intervals (CIs) (Fig. 4A). During the induction phase, pooled results for efficacy outcomes in patients with CD showed that a higher proportion of patients treated with infliximab achieved a CDAI-70 response, CDAI-100 response or clinical remission with non-overlapping 95% CIs, in comparison with patients treated with vedolizumab (Fig. 5A, Additional file 1: Figs. 1–2). In the maintenance phase, a CDAI-70 response was not reported for vedolizumab, so only the data for infliximab is presented (Additional file 1: Fig. 3); a numerical advantage with overlapping 95% CIs was observed with infliximab over vedolizumab for CDAI-100 and clinical remission (Fig. 5B, Additional file 1: Figs. 4). Pooled results for safety outcomes (Fig. 6A; Additional file 1: Figs. 5–10) showed that the proportions of patients experiencing AEs, SAEs, or who discontinued due to AEs were similar in infliximab- and vedolizumab-treated patients. A higher rate of infection was reported with infliximab; however, when it comes to serious infections, similar rates between infliximab and vedolizumab are observed. Six percent of patients treated with infliximab discontinued because the treatment was ineffective (Additional file 1: Fig. 10) while one study was available for vedolizumab, where almost one-third of patients (37.7%) discontinued vedolizumab treatment due to lack of efficacy in the maintenance phase.\n",
    "The findings for the meta-analyses for infliximab and vedolizumab in patients with UC are presented in Figs. 4B and 6B (Additional file 1: Figs. 11–20), with a summary presented in Table 2. Pooled results for efficacy outcomes in patients with UC showed that in the induction phase, a higher proportion of patients treated with infliximab achieved a clinical response or clinical remission with non-overlapping 95% CIs, compared with patients treated with vedolizumab (Fig. 2A, Additional file 1: Fig. 11). In the maintenance phase, similar proportions of patients treated with infliximab or vedolizumab achieved a clinical response, clinical remission or mucosal healing, with overlapping 95% CIs (Fig. 2B; Additional file 1: Figs. 13–14). Pooled results for safety outcomes showed that the proportions of patients experiencing AEs or infections, or who discontinued due to AEs, were similar in the infliximab and vedolizumab groups (Fig. 6B; Additional file 1: Figs. 15–20); rates of SAEs and serious infections were also similar with overlapping 95% CIs. Fourteen percent of patients with vedolizumab discontinued due to lack of efficacy (Additional file 1: Fig. 20); no available was available for infliximab.\n",
    "The present study is the first systematic review to compare the efficacy and safety of infliximab and vedolizumab in adult patients with moderate-to-severe CD or moderate-to-severe UC in order to address a lack of evidence of a direct comparison between the treatments. Data were extracted and pooled for the prespecified outcomes of interest at the corresponding 6-week and/or 50- to 54-week timepoints, respectively. Notably, the present evidence synthesis is the first to our knowledge to incorporate data for CT-P13 SC, an SC formulation of the infliximab.\n",
    "Our results show that infliximab yielded better efficacy than vedolizumab for all the efficacy outcomes in patients with CD or UC during the induction phase, and comparable clinical efficacies with overlapping 95% CI in both diseases during the maintenance phase. The safety profiles of infliximab and vedolizumab in both cohorts were generally similar in terms of the proportions of patients experiencing AEs, SAEs, infection, and serious infection, as well as the rates of discontinuations due to AEs in the analysed study period.\n",
    "Based on the demographics and clinical characteristics of the study populations contributing to the review, the present findings are applicable to patients with moderate-to-severe CD or UC and support the use of infliximab as a first-line biologic in these populations, per guideline recommendations. The quality of the evidence was broadly considered to be moderate to high on the guidelines. Prespecified outcomes of interest were well reported in the included studies, and meta-analyses included ≥ 200 patients for the majority of outcomes evaluated.\n",
    "Risk of bias in the included studies was principally considered to be low or was unclear (i.e. due to a lack of necessary information in the study reports). However, several studies were considered to be at high risk of ‘other bias’. Notably, the GEMINI 1, GEMINI 2, VISIBLE 1, and PLANETCD studies were considered to be at high risk of bias on the basis of only including patients in the maintenance phase if they had responded during the induction phase (i.e. at 6 weeks). This practice may potentially lead to overestimation of efficacy in the maintenance phase and overall safety, compared with studies in which both responders and non-responders were included in the maintenance phase. Therefore, the data relating to non-responders’ efficacy in infliximab (NOR-SWITCH and PLANETCD) and vedolizumab (GEMINI 1, GEMINI 2, and VISIBLE 1) during maintenance phase may not be generalized. Future studies should address the limitation of selectively progressing responders to the maintenance period, to permit transparent comparability of biological agents available for the treatment of IBD.\n",
    "The level of heterogeneity observed within the meta-analyses was generally high, with I2 values exceeding 60% in a number of instances. This was likely influenced by the inclusion of studies with heterogeneous populations (e.g., TNFi-naïve patients and patients who had not responded adequately to prior TNFi therapy), as evidenced by the broad range of median disease durations reported across studies. It was not possible to conduct sensitivity analyses to address the source of heterogeneity due to small amount of available data. Likewise, the head-to-head trial is in need to address biases among the population and different study designs.\n",
    "Several systematic reviews have examined the efficacy and/or safety of infliximab and vedolizumab in IBD. Our results confirm a prior comparative effectiveness and safety study in CD. A study by Singh et al. (2018) concluded that infliximab was ranked highest among biological therapies for induction and maintenance of clinical remission. When comparing infliximab and vedolizumab in TNF-naïve patients, infliximab yielded significantly better clinical response rates during the induction phase (Odds ratio (OR) 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.08 [0.02 − 0.36]) and numerical advantages in clinical remission rates during both induction and maintenance phases (OR [95% CI]: induction 0.46 [0.16 − 1.26], maintenance 0.81 [0.39 − 1.67]). Consistent with these findings, the present study demonstrated the similar patterns of outcomes even when we included the most recent data from infliximab and vedolizumab studies (i.e., VISIBLE, VARSITY, the CT-P13 SC trial).\n",
    "In UC, two network meta-analyses and one meta-analysis were conducted. The most recent network meta-analysis by Zhou et al. (2021) found no significant difference between vedolizumab and infliximab on clinical response. Zhou and colleagues also found no difference between the treatments in clinical remission rates during induction phase, while Singh et al. reported a better clinical remission rate of infliximab in biologic-naïve patients (OR [95% CI]: clinical remission 0.62 [0.34 − 1.15]). The present study is in line with the clinical remission results of the past studies.\n",
    "According to Zhou, endoscopic improvement rates were higher in infliximab compared to vedolizumab in biologic-naïve patients during induction therapy in UC (OR [95% CI]: 0.76 [0.42 − 1.37]); however, research by Cholapranee et al. (2017) reported that vedolizumab had higher mucosal healing rates than infliximab in the induction phase (OR [95% CI]: 0.63 [0.29 − 1.41]). Nevertheless, vedolizumab resulted in lower rates of mucosal healing compared to infliximab during the maintenance phase (OR [95% CI]: 1.17 [0.35–3.84]). The mucosal healing rates were numerically similar in the maintenance phase in the current study which disagrees to the prior meta-analyses. The reason for such a discrepancy may be due to the fact that the timeframe of our interest was different from the other studies.\n",
    "Concerning the safety outcomes in patients with UC, Zhou and colleagues found that vedolizumab resulted in fewer occurrences of adverse events than infliximab (relative risk (RR): 0.79 [0.62 − 0.94]). Although insignificant, the serious adverse events were lower in vedolizumab; and a lower risk of infections was found in infliximab during maintenance therapy (RR [95% CI]: serious adverse event 1.12 [0.58 − 2.14], infection 0.80 [0.48 − 1.34]). The results conform to our safety outcomes, but in the current study, the proportions of patients experiencing serious adverse event and serious infection were comparable between the treatments with overlapping 95% CIs.\n",
    "Narula and colleagues reported a post-hoc analysis of three UC clinical trial programmes, to compare the efficacy of infliximab and vedolizumab in patients with moderate-to-severe biologic-naïve UC. Broadly in agreement with the findings of the present review, the authors reported higher 1-year rates of clinical remission (corticosteroid free) and endoscopic remission with infliximab in comparison with vedolizumab, although the agents appeared to have similar efficacy in clinical symptom improvement.\n",
    "Strengths of the present review process include prospective registration of the protocol (as documented on PROSPERO, comprehensive electronic searches and assessment of the included studies for risk of bias using gold-standard methods. Potential limitations of the review process include that a study was incorporated from outside of the prespecified time limits (to replace a recent article reporting data from the ACT 1 and ACT 2 studies); only articles published from 2010 onwards were used to ensure inclusion of studies relevant to current treatment practices, although we note that clinical practice continually evolves. For example, more recently, higher 10 mg/kg doses of infliximab are used in severe cases of IBD, and trough levels are actively monitored. Such practices would tend to favour infliximab over vedolizumab, both in terms of observed efficacy and safety (e.g., monitoring of trough levels helps to reduce the risk of infusion reaction during induction phase and loss of response).\n",
    "During the review process, we also noted that several studies were not registered, and results were thus untraceable, potentially leading to omission of some relevant data. Furthermore, some studies were excluded from the present review because the timepoints assessed did not match those prespecified in the review protocol. This omission of potentially valuable data highlights the need to standardise future study designs. The present review did not assess longer-term follow-up (i.e., beyond 1 year) despite a sustained response being important to patients. Longer-term follow-up in larger real-world cohorts may also be more relevant to analyse safety.\n",
    "Finally, the included studies enrolled different proportions of patients with previous biological treatment failure (potentially accounting for between-study differences in efficacy and accounting for some of the observed heterogeneity). Different proportions of TNFi-experienced patients in vedolizumab treatment groups compared to infliximab treatment group, which consists of TNF-naïve patients only. For instance, taking the VARSITY trial into account exhibited different results for vedolizumab. The VARSITY trial is a head-to-head trial that compared the efficacy and safety between adalimumab and vedolizumab in TNF-naïve patients with UC. Higher clinical response and remission rates were achieved during induction on the VARSITY trial in comparison with GEMINI 1 (Fig. 2A, Additional file 1: Fig. 11). On the other hand, considerably lower rates of mucosal healing and clinical remission were found in the VARSITY trial compared with the VISIBLE and GEMINI 1 during the maintenance phase (Fig. 2B, Additional file 1: Fig. 14). Largely accounting for the fact that the VISIBLE and GEMINI 1 studies included Week 6 responders only to the maintenance phase, while the VARSITY trial included patients regardless of Week 6 responsiveness.\n",
    "Despite limitations in the evidence, the present systematic review represents an up-to-date evaluation of data from RCTs of infliximab and vedolizumab in IBD, capturing important new data from recently published studies.\n",
    "Indirect comparison of infliximab and vedolizumab based on RCT data for the treatment of patients with IBD demonstrated that infliximab has significantly better efficacy in the induction phase, and comparable efficacy during the maintenance phase. A comparable safety profile including serious adverse event and serious infection between infliximab and vedolizumab was found over a year.\"\"\""

    "text2 = \"\"\"The inflammatory process of Crohn’s disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC), which are the two main forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), is thought to be driven by the infiltration of dysregulated proinflammatory immune cells into the inflamed intestinal tissue. This infiltration is facilitated by the interaction between the integrin α4β7, which is expressed on several circulating immune cell subsets including previously activated T‐cells, and its counterreceptor Mucosal Addressin Cell Adhesion Molecule‐1 (MAdCAM‐1), which is selectively expressed on the endothelial cells of intestinal venules.\n",
    "Vedolizumab is a humanised monoclonal IgG1 antibody that binds to α4β7 and inhibits the interaction with MAdCAM‐1. This prevents α4β7‐expressing immune cells from extravasating which leads to a decrease in local inflammatory activity. More recently, vedolizumab has been shown to modulate innate immunity, including macrophage and dendritic cell populations, in addition to adaptive immunity. The limited expression pattern of MAdCAM‐1 is thought to account for vedolizumab’s gut‐specific immunosuppressive effect which in turn translates into a beneficial safety profile.\n",
    "Vedolizumab is approved for the treatment of patients with moderate‐to‐severe CD or UC, where treatment with conventional therapy or an anti‐TNF agent has failed. Vedolizumab was originally developed for administration via intravenous (IV) infusions. Recently, a formulation for subcutaneous (SC) administration was approved for maintenance treatment following at least two IV infusions. This approval was based on the phase III trials VISIBLE 1 and VISIBLE 2 which evaluated SC vedolizumab treatment after two initial IV doses in CD and UC patients, respectively. The proportion of subjects in clinical remission 52 weeks after the start of treatment, which was the primary endpoint, was significantly higher in the SC vedolizumab‐treated group compared to the placebo group, in both trials. Median trough concentrations at steady state during SC vedolizumab were 30.2 and 34.6 μg/ml for CD and UC patients, respectively, which was substantially higher than the median trough level during IV treatment presented in VISIBLE 1 (11.1 μg/ml). In contrast, the average serum concentrations over time were rather similar (39.8 and 32.2 μg/ml, during SC and IV treatment, respectively). Finally, there were no new safety issues observed, other than the incidence of injection‐site reaction frequencies. However, data on patient experience or satisfaction were not presented in the VISIBLE publications, and studies to investigate the efficacy and safety of switching patients from maintenance IV to maintenance SC vedolizumab treatment in a real‐world setting are scarce. To our knowledge, there is only one report on the topic, and in that study, the follow‐up time after the switch was only 12 weeks. Given that the half‐life of the drug is approximately 26 days and that the wash‐out period is several months, such a short follow‐up time may not be adequate to examine the effectiveness of the SC formulation. Nevertheless, the authors described a 52% increase (p < 0.01) in the patients' faecal calprotectin levels at the end of their study which was rather unexpected. Thus, further studies are warranted.\n",
    "There are several potential benefits with SC as compared to IV administration of vedolizumab including a reduced burden of health care resources and increased patient convenience. Potential caveats with SC treatment are increased difficulties to ensure therapy compliance, fewer built‐in disease follow‐up visits, possible IV treatment preference and local skin reactions to SC injections.\n",
    "The aims of this study were to assess efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics, patient experience, patient satisfaction, and potential cost savings following a switch from IV to SC vedolizumab treatment in patients with inflammatory bowel disease in a real‐world setting.\n",
    "This was a prospective observational cohort study of a switch from maintenance IV to SC vedolizumab treatment in a population of adult IBD patients. The study was conducted at the Skane University Hospital, Sweden, with a 6‐month follow‐up period. Consecutive patients were approached regarding participation. Inclusion criteria comprised signed informed consent; diagnosis of CD, UC or IBD‐unclassified; and ongoing maintenance treatment with IV vedolizumab (previously received ≥3 doses of IV vedolizumab). Exclusion criteria comprised noticeable difficulties handling an SC injector pen, inability to give informed consent, or inability to comply with study procedures. The study was performed in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Ethical permission was granted by the regional research ethics committee in Lund, Sweden (DNR 2018/761). All patients provided written informed consent to participation before study entry.\n",
    "Patients were enrolled between December 2020 and June 2021. The study included a baseline visit, scheduled at the time‐point when the patient should have received the next dose of IV vedolizumab, and a follow‐up visit 6 months after the switch. A subset of patients, that was the first to be enrolled, could be evaluated also after 12 months. Additional visits were scheduled on demand in case of a suspected disease flare or potential side effects. All patients were switched to a dose of 108 mg vedolizumab SC every 2 weeks regardless of previous dose or dosing interval on IV vedolizumab. All conventional IBD treatments were permitted during the study and changes in the treatment regimen were allowed if clinically indicated. Dose optimization of SC vedolizumab to 108 mg weekly was done at the discretion of the treating physician based on a combination of clinical symptoms and biomarker levels. Any changes in treatment regimen throughout the study period were recorded.\n",
    "Baseline data recorded included diagnosis (CD, UC or IBD‐unclassified), gender, age at diagnosis, age at inclusion, weight, height, smoking status, time on IV vedolizumab before the switch, IV vedolizumab dose and dosing interval at inclusion, previous and current IBD treatment, disease characteristics according to the Montreal classification, and disease activity at baseline.\n",
    "The primary endpoint was change in disease activity defined by faecal calprotectin levels at 6 months after the switch to SC vedolizumab treatment. Faecal calprotectin is a sensitive and non‐subjective measure of disease activity that is not affected by placebo or nocebo effects. It reacts to an early increase in subclinical inflammatory activity and is expected to change earlier than clinical symptom levels in the event of a diminished therapeutic effect.\n",
    "Secondary endpoints were [all refer to 6 months of follow‐up unless otherwise indicated] (a) change in remission rates defined by a faecal calprotectin <150 μg/g and clinical disease activity indices: for CD patient‐based Harvey Bradshaw Index (HBI) ≤4 or Patient‐Reported Outcomes (PRO)2‐CD ≤11 and for UC Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index (SCCAI) ≤2 or PRO2‐UC = 0. PRO2 scores were applied in accordance with the STRIDE documents. Briefly, the PRO2‐CD is the sum of the daily soft or liquid stool frequency and abdominal pain (multiplied by the weighting factors 2 and 5, respectively) items from the Crohn’s Disease Activity Index, whereas the PRO2‐UC is the simple sum of the stool frequency and rectal bleeding items from the Mayo score; (b) change in the laboratory biomarker plasma C‐reactive protein (CRP); (c) change in clinical disease activity defined by the patient‐based HBI for CD and the SCCAI for UC, as well as symptom levels according to the Patient‐Reported Outcomes (PRO)‐2 criteria as described in the STRIDE documents; (d) subgroup analyses of patients that were dose optimised on IV vedolizumab, and patients with perianal CD, respectively; (e) subgroup analysis of patients that completed 12 months of follow‐up, including drug persistence (11 patients that had not completed 12 months of follow‐up but remained on the drug were censored), and evaluation of faecal calprotectin and plasma CRP levels. When all patients had completed the first 6 months of follow‐up, the study was closed and thus not all patients completed 12 months of follow‐up; (f) adverse events and local injection reactions; (g) serum vedolizumab trough levels and relation to faecal calprotectin levels (patients categorised into quartiles based on serum vedolizumab trough levels and median faecal calprotectin levels calculated per quartile), and SC vedolizumab dose optimization rates; (h) patient experience of switching from IV to SC treatment, overall injection experience and patient satisfaction with various aspects of the injector pen [see below for details]; (i) health‐related quality‐of‐life using the Short Health Scale (SHS) which is a validated four‐item questionnaire (symptom burden, social function, disease‐related worry and general well‐being; each item scored 0–5 with an SHS composite score ranging from 0 to 20) and (j) annualised cost savings per patient with SC as compared to IV treatment.\n",
    "Faecal calprotectin levels were analysed using an enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; PhiCal, Calpro AS). Serum vedolizumab trough levels were analysed by a Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) validated in‐house developed chemiluminescence ELISA at the Karolinska Institute (Stockholm, Sweden). Both methods are used in clinical routine care and the analyses were performed in clinical laboratories.\n",
    "Adverse events that occurred after study entry considered related or of possible relation to SC vedolizumab treatment or switch were documented. Local injection reactions including discomfort, pain, burning sensation and erythema; and patient satisfaction with the injector pen, overall injection experience, the experience of switching from IV to SC treatment; were evaluated using structured questionnaires (see Table 1 and Table S1 for details on items, questions asked and response options). The questions and response options were adapted from previously published questionnaires used in similar studies.\n",
    "Annualised treatment costs for IV treatment included the cost of an appointment with a nurse for drug administration and the cost of the drug. Treatment costs of SC treatment included annual drug costs only. The rates of patients that were dose escalated on IV and SC treatment, respectively, were accounted for in the calculation.\n",
    "Data are presented as mean values with standard deviation (SD), or median values with interquartile range (IQR) as appropriate. Prism 9 for Mac OS X version 9.3.1 (GraphPad Software, Inc.) was used for statistical analyses and to graph data. The paired‐samples Student’s t‐test alternatively the Wilcoxon matched‐pair signed‐rank test was used to compare baseline and follow‐up data for changes in laboratory biomarkers, disease activity indices and quality‐of‐life scores as appropriate depending on data scale type and data distribution. Missing data are shown by presenting numbers of data points in the figures. The complete case analysis method was applied, which together with an account of discontinued patients and data point numbers presented, was deemed to give the most adequate description of the cohort. The approach was verified by performing sensitivity analyses comprising best‐ and worst‐case scenario calculations (i.e. missing data equals relapse and remission, respectively), neither of which altered the statistical significance as compared with the complete case analysis. Regarding faecal calprotectin‐missing data, the missing‐at‐random assumption is plausible and the complete case analysis is thus adequate to apply. The Kruskal–Wallis test was used to assess differences in faecal calprotectin levels between patient groups stratified by serum vedolizumab trough level quartiles during IV and SC vedolizumab treatment, respectively. The chi‐square test was used to compare remission rates between groups. Kaplan–Meier survival analysis was used to calculate drug persistence. A statistically significant test result was defined by p < 0.05.\n",
    "Eighty‐nine patients (48 patients with CD, 41 patients with UC and no patients with IBD‐unclassified) were included in the study. In total, 102 patients were approached regarding participation. Twelve patients declined participation, and one patient did not meet the inclusion criteria (Figure 1). Baseline patient characteristics, clinical disease activity scores, laboratory biomarkers, concomitant IBD treatment and time on IV vedolizumab are presented in Table 2. Details on previous IBD treatments and changes during follow‐up are presented in Table S2. The median time on IV vedolizumab before the switch was 26.1 months (IQR 9.5–52.9). The wide IQR illustrates heterogeneity in terms of previous exposure time to vedolizumab. At baseline, four patients received low dose oral prednisolone (1.25–10 mg daily), and three patients received oral budesonide. Prednisolone could be discontinued in one of these patients. Results refer to 6 months follow‐up, unless otherwise specified.\n",
    "For the cohort as a whole and the subgroup of CD patients, significant decreases in faecal calprotectin median levels were observed following the switch, whereas no change was seen in UC patients (Figure 2A). The remission rates as defined by faecal calprotectin remained stable for all three groups (Figure 2B). A subgroup analysis of faecal calprotectin levels in patients with limited ileal CD showed a median of 145 μg/g (IQR 48–281) at baseline and 94 μg/g (IQR 50.0–175.5) at follow‐up. The corresponding values for the entire CD group were 64.0 (IQR 12.5–238.5) μg/g and 49.0 μg/g (IQR 12.5–161.8), respectively. Analyses of plasma CRP levels did not show any significant changes before compared with after switch for the cohort as a whole, nor in the CD and UC subgroups (data not shown).\n",
    "Clinical disease activity in patients with CD, as measured by average patient‐based HBI and PRO2‐CD scores, remained unchanged (Figure 3A). Patients with UC displayed a statistically significant improvement in clinical symptoms according to the SCCAI although the median score remained unchanged, while the PRO2‐UC score did not show a significant change (Figure 3C). There were no statistically significant changes in the proportions of patients displaying clinical remission, as defined by patient‐based HBI ≤4 or PRO2‐CD ≤11 for patients with CD, and by SCCAI ≤2 or PRO2‐UC = 0 for patients with UC (Figure 3B,D).\n",
    "At baseline, 10 patients had a diagnosis of perianal CD. Three of these had active perianal disease at baseline, and at follow‐up, this number was two.\n",
    "Twenty patients were on optimised IV vedolizumab dosing at baseline. At follow‐up, there was no significant change in their faecal calprotectin levels, whereas the 69 patients that had been on standard IV vedolizumab dosing showed a small but significant decrease (Figure 4A). Faecal calprotectin remission rates (Figure 4A) and plasma CRP median values (data not shown) remained unchanged in both groups. Clinical remission rates remained stable at follow‐up (Figure 4B,C) except for the PRO2‐UC remission rate for UC patients that had been on standard IV vedolizumab dosing, where a statistically significant improvement was seen (Figure 4C).\n",
    "Dose optimization of SC vedolizumab to 108 mg weekly was deemed indicated in 10.1% of patients (6 CD, 3 UC). Three of these (1 CD, 2 UC) belonged to the subgroup of 20 patients (22.5%) that had been on intensified IV vedolizumab dosing before the switch, whereas the other 17 (85%) remained on standard SC dosing. All patients with perianal CD (n = 10) remained on treatment, but 3/10 were dose optimised to SC vedolizumab 108 mg weekly. No patient required hospitalisation or IV corticosteroid treatment due to disease worsening during the study.\n",
    "A subset of patients was evaluated at 12 months after the switch, in addition to the more comprehensive evaluation after the primary follow‐up period of 6 months. Drug persistence at 6 and 12 months were 95.5% (85/89) and 88.5% (69/78), respectively, for the whole cohort (Figure 5). Reasons for drug discontinuation (n = 9) were disease worsening in five patients, change in treatment regimen due to extraintestinal manifestations (present before the switch) in one patient, local injection reaction in one patient and adverse events in two patients (headache and repeated infections). There were no statistically significant changes in plasma CRP levels for the whole cohort (n = 50), CD (n = 27) or UC (n = 23); or in faecal calprotectin levels for the whole cohort (n = 20), CD (n = 10) or UC (n = 10), at 12 months (data not shown).\n",
    "Median serum vedolizumab trough levels at steady state on IV treatment (i.e. at baseline) were 8.1 μg/ml (IQR 5.2–14 μg/ml) for the whole cohort, 8.7 μg/ml (IQR 4.9–14.0 μg/ml) in CD patients, and 7.9 μg/ml (IQR 5.3–12.5 μg/ml) in UC patients. Median serum vedolizumab trough levels at steady state on SC treatment (i.e. at 6 months follow‐up) were 19.0 μg/ml (IQR 13.0–23.0 μg/ml) for the whole cohort, 19.0 μg/ml (IQR 12.0–22.8 μg/ml) in CD patients, and 18.5 μg/ml (IQR 15.0–23.8 μg/ml) in UC patients. When patients were on IV treatment, we found significantly higher faecal calprotectin levels, primarily among CD patients, in the quartiles with the lowest serum vedolizumab trough levels compared to those with higher serum vedolizumab trough levels (Figure 6A). This relationship was not observed after patients had been on SC treatment for 6 months (Figure 6B).\n",
    "We observed no differences in the SHS composite score or separate SHS items (Figure S1). Patient satisfaction with the injector pen (all eight categories; see Table S1 for details) was high with 94.1%–100% of patients responding “strongly agree”, “agree” or “agree to some extent” (Figure 7A). Overall satisfaction with the injection experience was generally high with 96.4% of the patients reporting being satisfied or very satisfied (Figure 7B). Generally, patients favoured SC administration over IV (Figure 7C). Only 2.4–9.4% of patients reported a slight preference for IV treatment over SC. Conversely, 55.3% of patients experienced SC treatment as slightly or clearly more effective, and 85.9% slightly or clearly more convenient (Figure 7C). Regarding overall feeling of security, no preference was the most frequent response (58.8%) and a slight preference for IV treatment was reported by 9.4% of patients (Figure 7C). Taking all aspects that follow with the given route of administration into account, 83.3% of patients reported a preference for SC over IV treatment, whereas the opposite was true for 2.4% of patients (Figure 7C).\n",
    "All reported adverse events are presented in Table 1. Adverse events, excluding local injection reactions, occurred in 15 (31.3%) of CD patients and 10 (24.4%) of UC patients. The corresponding rates for IV treatment were 27.1% and 22.0%, respectively. Some patients reported several side effects. The most common complaint was fatigue, followed by headache, nausea and rash. No serious adverse events were reported. Data on local skin reactions including discomfort, pain, burning sensation and erythema are presented in Table 1. The vast majority experienced none or only mild local injection reactions (88.0%–94.0% of patients, depending on the type of local injection reaction). Similar numbers were seen among CD and UC patients. Severe local symptoms were reported in only 1.2% of patients for the various subcategories. There was one case of drug discontinuation due to local injection reactions at 12 months of follow‐up, but none during the first 6 months.\n",
    "In Sweden, the current fee for a visit to a registered nurse for administration of an IV infusion is approximately €290; the annual drug cost for IV vedolizumab (standard dosing) is approximately €13,700; and the annual drug cost for SC vedolizumab (standard dosing) is approximately €13,800. During IV vedolizumab treatment, 22.5% of patients required dose optimization (one infusion of 300 mg every 4–7 weeks or 600 mg every 8 weeks), and during SC vedolizumab treatment 10.1% were dose optimised to 108 mg of SC vedolizumab once weekly. Taking these factors into account, the annualised cost of maintenance treatment with SC vedolizumab was 15.0% lower than for maintenance treatment with IV vedolizumab.\n",
    "The phase III VISIBLE studies investigated de novo treatment with SC vedolizumab. However, studies on switching patients that are on established maintenance treatment with IV vedolizumab to SC treatment are largely lacking. We report on a switch from IV to SC vedolizumab maintenance treatment in 89 adult IBD patients in a real‐world setting with a follow‐up time of 6 months and for a subgroup 12 months. Our results show that the levels of therapeutic efficacy, quality‐of‐life and adverse events were highly similar before as compared to after the switch with a high degree of drug persistence, and that the patients were in general very satisfied with being transferred to self‐administered SC treatment.\n",
    "Faecal calprotectin levels showed a statistically significant decrease for the cohort as a whole and for CD patients, while levels remained unchanged for UC patients. However, absolute levels were low and the observed decreases may not be clinically relevant. On the other hand, subclinical changes in faecal calprotectin levels are considered to precede changes in clinical disease activity and decreases of this type may further stabilise a state of clinical remission. Drug persistence was high with 95.5% of patients remaining on treatment after 6 months, and 88.5% after 12 months. These numbers are in line with those reported for IV vedolizumab treatment, ranging from 60–95% after 12 months.\n",
    "Our evaluation of the outcome of the switch included thorough investigations of clinical disease activity, applying two activity indices for CD (patient‐based HBI and PRO2‐CD) and two for UC (SCCAI and PRO2‐UC), analysed by both median values and by proportions of patients in remission. All of these analyses corroborated the faecal calprotectin data, showing either unchanged disease activity levels after the switch in both CD and UC patients, or as in the case of SCCAI levels, a statistically significant improvement. For the 10 patients with perianal CD, the patient‐based HBI questionnaire was of particular interest since it included separate questions regarding active perianal fistula, perianal abscesses and anal fissures. At baseline, 3/10 had an active perianal disease but after the switch the number was 2/10 at follow‐up. From the literature, it seems that vedolizumab may have some therapeutic effect on perianal CD in a subset of patients, but that the effectiveness overall is moderate. Our results do not contradict this view, but one should be cautious regarding conclusions given the low number of patients with perianal CD.\n",
    "We also performed a subgroup analysis of patients with limited ileal CD, which showed measurable levels of faecal calprotectin with a numerical decrease after the switch. This confirms that faecal calprotectin was an adequate readout parameter also for this subset of CD patients, which has been debated but several recent studies have shown that faecal calprotectin is a sensitive measure of disease activity also in cases with limited ileal disease.\n",
    "The SC dose of 108 mg every 2 weeks was chosen by the manufacturer with the intent to provide patients with similar average serum concentrations at steady state, as the IV dose of 300 mg every 8 weeks. However, it is unclear whether average serum concentrations directly translate into levels of therapeutic efficacy. In addition, it is possible that the altered pharmacokinetics that comes with SC administration affect the various mechanisms of action of vedolizumab (i.e. those suggested to take place in the circulation compared to within tissues) in different ways. Although the VISIBLE studies gave us an indication as to what serum levels are common with SC vedolizumab at standard dose, the studies did not address which levels are therapeutically optimal. In our study, serum vedolizumab trough concentrations at steady state were approximately twice as high during SC as compared with IV treatment. These findings are in line with the VISIBLE studies and the study by Ventress et al. Our results suggest an inverse relationship between serum vedolizumab trough levels and faecal calprotectin levels with vedolizumab given IV. However, after 6 months with SC vedolizumab at standard dose, this correlation was not seen. This change was primarily observed in CD patients, which also displayed a statistically significant decrease in faecal calprotectin levels after having switched to SC treatment. Our subgroup analyses of patients that had been on optimised IV dosing did not show any signs of disease worsening in terms of remission rates, clinical index scores, biomarker levels or drug persistence, after the switch to standard SC dosing. Interestingly, patients on standard IV dosing showed a statistically significant improvement in faecal calprotectin levels on SC treatment, while other outcome measures remained unchanged. Taken together, these results suggest that some patients were underdosed when being on standard IV dosing and that they were more adequately dosed (or potentially overdosed at the group level) on SC standard dosing.\n",
    "Ventress et al. suggested that the first dose of SC vedolizumab should be given 28 days after the last IV dose. This was based on the assumption that the serum drug concentrations observed in the VISIBLE studies are therapeutically the most appropriate (although this has not been studied) and that the drug levels should be kept at or above this limit. With IV vedolizumab, patients' drug levels are below this limit during the entire second half of the 8‐week dosing interval. There is no evidence that the limited time that serum concentrations are below the SC serum steady‐state levels in the VISIBLE studies increases the risk of relapse, nor for dose‐dependent toxicity, if the first SC dose is given in close proximity to the last IV dose. Thus, with current knowledge and with support from our data we would argue that the first SC dose may be administered when the next IV dose would have been given, or earlier due to potential practical aspects.\n",
    "In our cohort, the rates of adverse events were similar before and after the switch, and no serious adverse events were reported. Some of the reported symptoms, including fatigue, headache, nausea and arthralgia, were transient and lasted 1–2 days after injection. The time to the maximum serum concentration after administration of vedolizumab subcutaneously is on average 7 days with a variation between 3–14 days. Such transient reactions are thus not likely to be an effect of the drug per se but more likely representing nonpharmacological potentially immune‐mediated adverse effects, alternatively representing a nocebo effect. Investigating local injection reactions, moderate discomfort, pain or burning sensations were reported by 5%–11% of patients, and corresponding severe reactions by 1% of the patients. Conversely, 88%–94% reported none or only mild local injection reactions. These results are in line with the VISIBLE studies as well as with data for other SC biologics. SC vedolizumab contains citrate which has been pointed out to be causing pain, but studies that have addressed this issue underscore that citrate is merely one of several factors that may affect potential pain sensation at SC injection and that some of the studies attributing pain at the injection site to citrate are difficult to interpret since citrate was one of several factors modified. Other factors that may be equally important in this context are other buffers commonly used such as phosphate and histidine, the buffer concentration, injected volume, solution temperature, pH, osmolality, needle gauge, injector device, injection speed, injection technique and low body weight.\n",
    "We also investigated various aspects of the patients' experience with the injector pen and the switch from IV to SC treatment. Overall patients found the injector pen to be user‐friendly and they were very satisfied with switching to SC treatment, which was reflected in all aspects explored. However, this dataset can also be used to illuminate the group of patients, albeit small (2%–9%), that preferred IV infusions. Thus, SC administration may not be the best option for all patients. One caveat with SC treatment is that it may be more difficult to ensure patient compliance. Hence, for patients where compliance historically has been a problem or if risk factors for non‐adherence are present, IV therapy may be advisable.\n",
    "Evaluations of health‐related quality‐of‐life using the SHS instrument showed no statistically significant differences after the switch, but there was a slight numerical trend towards improved overall quality‐of‐life as well as better symptom‐related and social function‐related quality‐of‐life in patients with CD. These findings underscore the high level of satisfaction regarding the switch.\n",
    "The annualised cost of SC vedolizumab maintenance treatment was calculated to be 15.0% lower than for IV maintenance treatment. Another structural benefit was that nurse resources were liberated for other work tasks. This was especially valuable in times of a pandemic when the number of nurses at the outpatient clinic had to be diminished to enable staffing of Covid‐19 wards. In addition, avoiding hospital visits in this context was desirable to prevent transmission of the virus.\n",
    "This study had some important limitations. Firstly, there was no control group that was continued on IV treatment. Secondly, patients were not evaluated endoscopically. Lastly, anti‐drug antibodies were not measured.\n",
    "In conclusion, this study shows that a switch from IV to SC vedolizumab maintenance treatment can be done with maintained efficacy, safety and tolerability, including in patients on optimised IV vedolizumab dosing. In addition, patient satisfaction regarding the switch was overall high, although for a small proportion of patients IV treatment may be advisable. The appropriate window for serum vedolizumab concentration to target for combined optimal efficacy, patient convenience and cost‐effectiveness during SC maintenance treatment, is still unclear and should be addressed in future studies.\n",

    "text3 = \"\"\"In recent years, the emergence of arboviruses and their spillover transmission to humans have been causing major health and economic problems worldwide. In particular, re-emerging flaviviruses, such as tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), West Nile virus (WNV) and yellow fever virus (YFV), and alphaviruses, such as chikungunya virus (CHIKV), are arboviruses that are causative of severe and life-threatening diseases. Flaviviruses and alphaviruses are small, enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses transmitted primarily by Aedes spp. mosquitoes. As part of their viral replication cycle, TBEV, WNV, YFV and CHIKV enter host cells via viral glycoprotein receptor-mediated endocytosis to infect cells and then synthesize viral proteins and replicate their genome. No approved drugs or vaccines are available for the treatment of many of the most important arboviruses in circulation today; therefore, efforts to prevent these diseases are urgently needed and must be addressed.\n",
    "As de novo antiviral drug development requires long R&D ranges and large investments, drug repurposing is one of the most rapid and promising strategies for the identification of effective treatments for diseases caused by pathogens. Additionally, the repurposing of clinically approved drugs for application in the treatment of an emerging or re-emerging viral infection is a method that is widely used. Here, we carried out high-throughput repurposing screening from a FDA-approved drug library containing 2580 small-molecule compounds to identify broad-spectrum antivirals for TBEV, WNV, YFV and CHIKV. In total, 60 molecules that showed antiviral effects against these four arboviruses were identified. Ixazomib and ixazomib citrate (inhibitors of 20S proteasome β5) exerted high antiviral potency in vitro, showing low-micromolar antiviral effects. Additionally, the role of ixazomib and ixazomib citrate in the life cycle of viruses was investigated further. The anti-CHIKV activities of ixazomib and ixazomib citrate in vivo were evaluated using a mouse model. To our knowledge, this study is the first to describe the antiviral efficacy of ixazomib against emerging flaviviruses and alphaviruses, and it demonstrates that ixazomib is a promising broad-spectrum antiviral candidate.\n",
    "Human hepatoma Huh7 cells (SCSP-526, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China) were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA, USA), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA, USA), 1% L-glutamine (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and 1% non-essential amino acids (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA, USA) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. A tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV)-infectious clone of the Zmeinogorsk-5 strain (KY069125), a WNV-infectious clone of the NY2000 strain (AF404756) and a chikungunya virus (CHIKV)-infectious clone of the LR2006 OPY1 strain were synthesized in this laboratory. Yellow fever virus (YFV0 strain) was isolated from the serum of a confirmed YF patient (FJYF03/2016, GenBank: KY587416.1).\n",
    "A Selleck library of FDA-approved drugs (L1300-Z349373), consisting of 2580 compounds, was purchased from Selleck Chemicals (Houston, TX, USA). All of the compounds were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as 10 mM stock solutions and stored at −80 °C.\n",
    "All of the compounds were diluted in culture media to a final concentration of 5 μM during screening. Briefly, a total of 1 × 104 Huh7 cells were seeded in 96-well plates. Then, 12 h later, the cells were treated with compounds at 37 °C and 5% CO2 prior to infection with a virus at a MOI of 0.1. All of the treatments were conducted in triplicate for each compound. DMSO was used as a control. Next, 24 h post infection, the cells were fixed with methyl alcohol, and then, immunofluorescence imaging was performed to determine the infection rate of the viruses. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against the virus were prepared by immunizing rabbits with formaldehyde-inactivated viruses; the Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit IgG (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA); DAPI (1:10,000 dilution, Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany). Images were acquired using Cytation 5 (BioTek, El Segundo, CA, USA). The numbers of infected cells and the total cells in each well were counted using Gen5 3.10. Then, the infection rate of each compound-treated group was calculated in Prism.\n",
    "The antiviral activity of the selectixib ed compounds was further validated by carrying out dose–response studies. In total, 1 × 104 Huh7 cells were seeded in 96-well plates. Then, 12 h later, the cells were treated with eight 2-fold serial dilutions of compounds. The final concentration of the compounds ranged from 20 μM to 0.15625 μM. DMSO was used as a control. Viruses’ working stocks were added to the treated Huh7 cells at a MOI of 0.1. Next, 24 h after the virus incubation, the infection rate of the viruses was determined using immunofluorescence imaging, as described above. The concentration of 50% of the maximal effect (EC50) of each compound was calculated in Prism. In addition, parallel plates that were not infected were analyzed to monitor the cytotoxicity of each compound. The cells were maintained at 37 °C and at 5% CO2 for 48 h before a CCK-8 assay was performed, following the manufacturer’s instructions (Beyotime, Shanghai, China). The A450 was read using Synergy 2 (BioTek, El Segundo, CA, USA). The CC50 of each compound was calculated in Prism.\n",
    "To carry out the time-of-drug-addition assay, 1 × 104 Huh-7 cells were seeded in 96-well plates in advance. Then, 12 h later, each compound (5 μM) was added 2 h before virus infection, simultaneously with the virus addition and 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 h after virus infection, and the compound action period was 2 h (the action period of adding compounds after 12 h of virus infection was 12 h). The virus incubation period was 2 h. DMSO was used as a control. After the drug treatment, the medium was replaced with fresh DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum for 24 h. After fixation with methanol solution, the infection rates were detected using immunofluorescence imaging, as described above.\n",
    "Four-week-old female C57BL/6 mice were used for the in vivo evaluation of the anti-CHIKV activity of the compounds. All of the procedures that involved animals were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Committee for Animal Care and Biosafety of Navy Medical University. All of the experiments complied with the relevant ethical regulations. All of the mouse infection studies were performed in a laboratory with an animal biosafety level of 3. For the animal experiments, the C57BL/6 mice were randomly distributed into 4 groups. Each group consisted of nine mice. Three groups of mice were inoculated subcutaneously in the left rear foot with 106 focus-forming units (FFUs) of the CHIKV LR2006 OPY1 strain, as described previously. One group was used as a normal control, which did not undergo virus infection. Starting on day 1 after CHIKV inoculation, mice in groups 1–3 received different compounds at appropriate doses: vehicle, ixazomib (7 mg/kg) or ixazomib citrate (11 mg/kg), via oral administration, once daily for 4 consecutive days. Three mice were monitored daily for left rear footpad swelling with digital calipers for 9 days. Three mice per group were sacrificed at 3 days post infection (dpi) and 5 dpi; their hamstring muscle tissues from the left rear foot were collected for virus load evaluation, and the sera were collected for viremia evaluation, as described previously. The viral load and inflammation in the muscle tissues were determined using quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) methods. The qRT-PCR of virus RNA was performed using SYBR Premix Ex TaqTMII (Tli RNaseH Plus) (TaKaRa, Kusatsu, Japan). The expression of target genes was normalized to GAPDH mRNA levels in the same samples. The primer sequences were as follows: CHIKV (genome location: 3171–3276 bases), 5′-GGCAGTGGTCCCAGATAATTCAAG-3′ and 5′-ACTGTCTAGATCCACCCCATACATG-3′; GAPDH, 5′-TGGGCTACACTGAGCACCAG-3′ and 5′-AAGTGGTCGTTGAGGGCAAT-3′; monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), 5′-CAGCCAGATGCAGTTAACGC-3′ and 5′-CAGACCTCTCTCTTGAGCTTGG-3′; tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), 5′-AATTCGAGTGACAAGCCTGTAGC-3′ and 5′-AGTAGACAAGGTACAACCCATCG-3′.\n",
    "Bar and line graphs showing the means ± SEMs of at least three independent experiments were plotted. Statistical analyses were performed using Prism 5 (GraphPad Software). Data were analyzed using either the Student’s t-test or one-way ANOVA. p-values are indicated by *, p < 0.05, **, p < 0.01 and ***, p < 0.001.\n",
    "A high-throughput screening assay was performed to screen antiviral candidates against TBEV, WNV, YFV and CHIKV from 2580 FDA-approved small-molecule drugs. Huh7 cells and TBEV, WNV, YFV and CHIKV viruses were used for this screening. Figure 1a shows the procedure used in the screening assay. In total, 60 compounds showed potent antiviral activity against TBEV, WNV, YFV and CHIKV, meaning they could inhibit the infection of the four viruses by more than 90% in Huh7 cells at a final concentration of 5 μM. To validate the antiviral activity of these 60 compounds, monkey kidney epithelial cells, Vero cells, were utilized. Thrillingly, all of the compounds exerted inhibitory effects against the four viruses by more than 85% in Vero cells at a final concentration of 5 μM, which suggested that the antiviral activities of these compounds were not cell-dependent. Ivacaftor (an enhancer of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) was identified to show antiviral activity for the first time. Additionally, two compounds, telotristat etiprate and sonodegib, which have also been reported to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in screening studies, were identified to inhibit the infection of TBEV, WNV, YFV and CHIKV. The enrichment of the known targets of these 60 drugs was analyzed and classified (Table S1). Six main targets were classified: receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), 20S proteasome β5, ion channel, DNA synthesis, antibacteria or protozoa drugs and natural products (Figure 1b). Numerous studies report RTK inhibitors, ion channel inhibitors, DNA synthesis inhibitors, antibacteria or protozoa drugs and natural products to be arbovirus antivirals. However, little work has been conducted regarding 20S proteasome β5 inhibitors as direct-acting antivirals. In this study, the antiviral efficacy of three 20S proteasome β5 inhibitors, ixazomib, ixazomib citrate and carfilzomib, was further evaluated.\n",
    "The 50% effective concentration (EC50) and 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC50) values of three 20S proteasome β5 inhibitors against TBEV, WNV, YFV and CHIKV were further evaluated in Huh7 cells. The working concentration of the drugs started at 20 μM, and eight 2-fold serial dilutions were performed (20–0.15625 μM). The CC50 of ixazomib and ixazomib citrate in Huh7 cells was shown to be 12.62 μM and 10.13 μM, respectively (Figure 2a,b). However, the cytotoxicity of carfilzomib was overt, being 0.15625 μM (Figure 2c). Thus, carfilzomib was excluded in the following study. Remarkably, the EC50 values of ixazomib and ixazomib citrate against these four viruses were found to lie in the submicromolar range (Figure 3). Additionally, the selective index (SI) of ixazomib against TBEV, WNV, YFV and CHIKV was 324.59, 125.198, 77.41 and 68.36, respectively. Ixazomib citrate also displayed antiviral activity that inhibited TBEV, WNV, YFV and CHIKV with the SI of 410.12, 98.16, 55.17 and 55.05, which is comparable with ixazomib.\n",
    "To investigate which stages of the TBEV, WNV, YFV and CHIKV life cycles were interrupted by ixazomib, a time-of-drug-addition assay was performed by treating virus-infected Huh7 cells with ixazomib or ixazomib citrate at various virus-specific time points, followed by immunofluorescence imaging 24 h post infection (hpi) (Figure 4a). Ixazomib inhibited TBEV infection in multiple periods. The prominent suppressive activity of ixazomib against TBEV occurred when it was maintained at 0–2 hpi, the stage of cell entry after attachment, which revealed that ixazomib inhibited mostly TBEV in the entry stage (Figure 4b). WNV and YFV infection was disrupted by ixazomib when it was maintained at 0–2 hpi and 2–4 hpi, suggesting ixazomib was involved in the viral entry and replication processes of both viruses (Figure 4c,d). Intriguingly, ixazomib significantly suppressed TBEV, WNV and YFV at 0–2 hpi, while ixazomib showed no inhibitory effect for CHIKV when it was maintained between 0 and 2 hpi, but it inhibited CHIKV infection when it was maintained at pre 2–0 hpi and 2–10 hpi (Figure 4e). The best suppressive activity was observed at 4–8 hpi, which demonstrated that ixazomib mostly interfered with the replication and package of CHIKV. At present, there are no relevant literature reports regarding the role of the 20S proteasome β5 in the infection process of TBEV, WNV, YFV and CHIKV. Whether ixazomib inhibited virus infection by suppressing the activity of 20S proteasome β5 remains unclear. Additionally, the mechanisms of ixazomib inhibiting TBEV, WNV, YFV and CHIKV need to be investigated further.\n",
    "To evaluate the antiviral effect of ixazomib in vivo further, a CHIKV infection mouse model was utilized. Four-week-old female C57BL/6 mice were divided into four groups: three groups received one of the following treatments beginning on day 1 after infection: vehicle, ixazomib (7 mg/kg) or ixazomib citrate (11 mg/kg), via oral administration at suitable doses; one group was used as a normal control group which did not undergo CHIKV infection. Animals were monitored for footpad swelling in the left rear foot, and viral loads in the left rear hamstring muscle were monitored at different times after infection and treatment. CHIKV-infected mice showed one peak of clinically apparent footpad swelling 6 days after infection. Compared with the vehicle-treated group, ixazomib and ixazomib citrate significantly alleviated the footpad swelling caused by CHIKV infection (Figure 5b). Additionally, the virus loads in the left rear hamstring muscles of mice with ixazomib and ixazomib citrate treatments were distinctly reduced compared with those of the vehicle-treated group when assayed on 3 dpi and 5 dpi (Figure 5c). The results demonstrated that ixazomib can effectively alleviate footpad swelling and suppress viral replication in mouse muscles. Concurrently, compared with the vehicle group, ixazomib or ixazomib citrate treatment decreased the viremia at 3 dpi (Figure 5d), while no CHIKV infection was detected at 5 dpi in all three groups (data not shown). In addition, the mRNA expression levels of monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) in the left rear hamstring muscle tissues were determined. At 3 dpi and 5 dpi, the MCP-1 and TNF-α mRNA expression levels were remarkably diminished in the mice treated with ixazomib and ixazomib citrate (Figure 5e,f). Taken together, ixazomib and ixazomib citrate inhibited CHIKV infection in vivo and attenuated inflammation caused by CHIKV.\n",
    "Arboviral infections have had profound effects on public health in many parts of the world. TBEV, WNV, YFV and CHIKV pose continuous health threats. In the face of the rapid rise in the number of emerging and reemerging infectious diseases and the lack of vaccines and drugs, there is an urgent need for therapeutic approaches that can target large classes of viruses using single drugs. Compared with novel drug development, drug repurposing has several advantages: it is faster, has good safety levels, causes few side effects and is inexpensive; these advantages mean that it is a plausible way to identify treatment candidates for emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases.\n",
    "In this study, a high-throughput screening assay was used to identify anti-TBEV, WNV, YFV and CHIKV candidates from 2580 FDA-approved small-molecule drugs, and 60 compounds were found to inhibit the infection of the four above mentioned arboviruses by more than 90% at a concentration of 5 μM in Huh7 cells. Although many of these compounds overlapped with several recent drug repurposing screening efforts for different viruses, for the first time, ivacaftor (an enhancer of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) showed antiviral activity. Additionally, telotristat etiprate (a tryptophan hydroxylase inhibitor) and sonodegib (a smoothened antagonist) were identified to inhibit the infection of TBEV, WNV, YFV or CHIKV for the first time. The targets of these 60 compounds were classified, and the pathways that these targets are involved in were analyzed. Notably, VEGFR is a pivotal target of a variety of viruses, which is the largest target group that was identified in this study.\n",
    "The ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS) is critical in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. As such, viruses exploit the UPS to manipulate host cells and then benefit their own infectious cycles. Proteasome activity is required in multiple stages of many different viruses’ infections. The UPS is reported to be involved in the life cycle process in different viruses. Proteasome-mediated stages of the initiation of the infection include endosomal escape, nucleocapsid trafficking and the uncoating of the viral genome. Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a member of the flavivirus genus. The UPS was shown to be involved in the endosomal escape stage of JEV entry. The transport of simian virus 49 (SV49) and BK polyomavirus (BKV) capsids from ER to the cytosol was shown to be dependent on UPS functions. Dengue virus (DENV) is another member of the flavivirus genus, and its uncoating stage (viral nucleic acid typically separates from viral core proteins to initiate viral replication) was reported to be likely affected by the UPS. In addition, many studies focus on viral genome replication that is dependent on UPS function. The 26S proteasome is at the heart of the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway and consists of a catalytic 20S proteasome and an ATP-dependent 19S cap. The 20S proteasome contains three proteolytic subunits with distinct caspase-like (β1), trypsin-like (β2) and chymotrypsin-like (β5) activities. However, the role of the β5 subunit of the 20S proteasome in the life cycle of viruses is complex and unclear.\n",
    "Ixazomib citrate is the first orally bioavailable inhibitor of the 20S proteasome to be evaluated for the treatment of multiple myeloma. It is more selective for the chymotrypsin-like (β5) protease, causing less inhibitory activity against other active subunits. Ixazomib citrate undergoes rapid hydrolysis to biologically active boronic acid, ixazomib, under physiological conditions. Ixazomib is reported to reactivate latent HIV and predispose reactivated cells to cell death. Additionally, ixazomib was evaluated for use in the treatment of EBV-associated B-cell neoplasms to target NF-κB signaling. It was also reported to be involved in the TRAIL/death receptor signaling and β-catenin/TCF signaling pathways. In our study, both ixazomib and ixazomib citrate showed excellent antiviral efficacy toward TBEV, WNV, YFV and CHIKV, with submicromolar EC50 data. Furthermore, ixazomib was involved in multiple stages of the TBEV and CHIKV life cycles and the early stages of the WNV and YFV life cycles. Of note, ixazomib inhibited TBEV infection with the best suppressive effect when maintained at 0–2 hpi after virus infection, the important entry stage after attachment, which demonstrated that ixazomib mostly inhibited TBEV in the entry stage. It is very interesting that ixazomib did not inhibit CHIKV infection when maintained at 0–2 hpi, but it did at 2–8 hpi. Moreover, the antiviral effect was most apparent when it was maintained between 4 and 8 hpi, which suggested that ixazomib may disturb the package of CHIKV particles. This study revealed that ixazomib performs different roles in different virus infection processes and has multiple roles in one virus life cycle. Additionally, it is worth considering that ixazomib may inhibit TBEV, WNV, YFV and CHIKV through UPS or through other targets, which requires further study.\n",
    "In order to evaluate the antiviral activity of ixazomib and ixazomib citrate in vivo, a CHIKV arthritis mouse model was utilized. C57BL/6 mice are susceptible to CHIKV infection, which has been widely used in studies concerning the pathogenicity of CHIKV. The results showed that both ixazomib and ixazomib citrate treatments effectively ameliorated footpad swelling and reduced muscle viral burdens at 3 dpi and 5 dpi. The results confirmed the antiviral activities of ixazomib and ixazomib citrate in vivo. Future research will aim to evaluate the antiviral effects of ixazomib against different arboviruses in vivo. As a FDA-approved drug for the treatment of multiple myeloma, the toxicity of ixazomib was systematically evaluated. While, as an anticancer drug, the toxicity is still a concern of ixazomib to be used for anti-virus infection in clinical settings, finding a safe therapeutic window may be feasible. Before ixazomib is applied as an antiviral agent in clinical settings, much more work is still required.\n",
    "In summary, we discovered a list of clinically approved drugs capable of inhibiting TBEV, WNV, YFV, and CHIKV in vitro in Huh7 cell lines. Moreover, we showed that ixazomib is involved in multiple stages of virus infection processes and performs different roles in different virus infection processes. Furthermore, the anti-CHIKV efficacy of ixazomib was validated in vivo using a mouse model. Our results showed that ixazomib may be a promising broad-spectrum antiviral agent for use against arbovirus infections.\n",

      "This systematic review compared the efficacy and safety of infliximab and vedolizumab in adult patients with moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. Data from six randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included in the analysis. Infliximab was found to be significantly more effective than vedolizumab during the induction phase, and comparable efficacy during the maintenance phase. A comparable safety profile including serious adverse event and serious infection was found between infliximab and vedolizumab over 1 year. The present study is the first systematic review to compare the efficacy and safety of infliximab and vedolizumab in adult patients with moderate-to-severe CD or UC in order to address a lack of evidence of a direct comparison between the treatments.\n",
      " この系統的レビューでは、中等度から重度のクローン病または潰瘍性大腸炎の成人患者を対象に、インフリキシマブとvedolizumabの有効性と安全性を比較した。6件のランダム化比較試験（RCT）のデータが解析に含まれた。インフリキシマブはvedolizumabよりも導入期において有意に有効であり、維持期においても同等の有効性が認められた。重篤な有害事象や重篤な感染症を含む安全性プロファイルは、1年間においてインフリキシマブとベドリズマブで同等であった。本研究は、中等症から重症のCDまたはUCの成人患者におけるインフリキシマブとvedolizumabの有効性と安全性を比較した最初の系統的レビューであり、両治療法を直接比較するエビデンスの欠如に対処するものである。\n"
