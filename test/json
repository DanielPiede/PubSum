More recently, vedolizumab has been shown to modulate innate immunity, including macrophage and dendritic cell populations, in addition to adaptive immunity.

Vedolizumab was originally developed for administration via intravenous (IV) infusions. Recently, a formulation for subcutaneous (SC) administration was approved for maintenance treatment following at least two IV infusions. This approval was based on the phase III trials VISIBLE 1 and VISIBLE 2 which evaluated SC vedolizumab treatment after two initial IV doses in CD and UC patients, respectively. The proportion of subjects in clinical remission 52 weeks after the start of treatment, which was the primary endpoint, was significantly higher in the SC vedolizumab\u2010treated group compared to the placebo group, in both trials. Median trough concentrations at steady state during SC vedolizumab were 30.2 and 34.6\u00a0\u03bcg/ml for CD and UC patients, respectively, which was substantially higher than the median trough level during IV treatment presented in VISIBLE 1 (11.1\u00a0\u03bcg/ml). In contrast, the average serum concentrations over time were rather similar (39.8 and 32.2\u00a0\u03bcg/ml, during SC and IV treatment, respectively). Finally, there were no new safety issues observed, other than the incidence of injection\u2010site reaction frequencies. However, data on patient experience or satisfaction were not presented in the VISIBLE publications, and studies to investigate the efficacy and safety of switching patients from maintenance IV to maintenance SC vedolizumab treatment in a real\u2010world setting are scarce. To our knowledge, there is only one report on the topic, and in that study, the follow\u2010up time after the switch was only 12\u2009weeks. Given that the half\u2010life of the drug is approximately 26\u2009days and that the wash\u2010out period is several months, such a short follow\u2010up time may not be adequate to examine the effectiveness of the SC formulation. Nevertheless, the authors described a 52% increase (p\u2009<\u20090.01) in the patients' faecal calprotectin levels at the end of their study which was rather unexpected. Thus, further studies are warranted.",

Inclusion criteria comprised signed informed consent; diagnosis of CD, UC or IBD\u2010unclassified; and ongoing maintenance treatment with IV vedolizumab (previously received \u22653 doses of IV vedolizumab). Exclusion criteria comprised noticeable difficulties handling an SC injector pen, inability to give informed consent, or inability to comply with study procedures. The study was performed in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Ethical permission was granted by the regional research ethics committee in Lund, Sweden (DNR 2018/761).

Missing data are shown by presenting numbers of data points in the figures. The complete case analysis method was applied, which together with an account of discontinued patients and data point numbers presented, was deemed to give the most adequate description of the cohort. The approach was verified by performing sensitivity analyses comprising best\u2010 and worst\u2010case scenario calculations (i.e. missing data equals relapse and remission, respectively), neither of which altered the statistical significance as compared with the complete case analysis. Regarding faecal calprotectin\u2010missing data, the missing\u2010at\u2010random assumption is plausible and the complete case analysis is thus adequate to apply. The Kruskal\u2013Wallis test was used to assess differences in faecal calprotectin levels between patient groups stratified by serum vedolizumab trough level quartiles during IV and SC vedolizumab treatment, respectively. The chi\u2010square test was used to compare remission rates between groups. Kaplan\u2013Meier survival analysis was used to calculate drug persistence.

All of these analyses corroborated the faecal calprotectin data, showing either unchanged disease activity levels after the switch in both CD and UC patients, or as in the case of SCCAI levels, a statistically significant improvement. For the 10 patients with perianal CD, the patient\u2010based HBI questionnaire was of particular interest since it included separate questions regarding active perianal fistula, perianal abscesses and anal fissures. At baseline, 3/10 had an active perianal disease but after the switch the number was 2/10 at follow\u2010up. From the literature, it seems that vedolizumab may have some therapeutic effect on perianal CD in a subset of patients, but that the effectiveness overall is moderate.

However, it is unclear whether average serum concentrations directly translate into levels of therapeutic efficacy. In addition, it is possible that the altered pharmacokinetics that comes with SC administration affect the various mechanisms of action of vedolizumab (i.e. those suggested to take place in the circulation compared to within tissues) in different ways. Although the VISIBLE studies gave us an indication as to what serum levels are common with SC vedolizumab at standard dose, the studies did not address which levels are therapeutically optimal. In our study, serum vedolizumab trough concentrations at steady state were approximately twice as high during SC as compared with IV treatment. These findings are in line with the VISIBLE studies and the study by Ventress et al. Our results suggest an inverse relationship between serum vedolizumab trough levels and faecal calprotectin levels with vedolizumab given IV. However, after 6\u2009months with SC vedolizumab at standard dose, this correlation was not seen. This change was primarily observed in CD patients, which also displayed a statistically significant decrease in faecal calprotectin levels after having switched to SC treatment. Our subgroup analyses of patients that had been on optimised IV dosing did not show any signs of disease worsening in terms of remission rates, clinical index scores, biomarker levels or drug persistence, after the switch to standard SC dosing. Interestingly, patients on standard IV dosing showed a statistically significant improvement in faecal calprotectin levels on SC treatment, while other outcome measures remained unchanged. Taken together, these results suggest that some patients were underdosed when being on standard IV dosing and that they were more adequately dosed (or potentially overdosed at the group level) on SC standard dosing.",

This was based on the assumption that the serum drug concentrations observed in the VISIBLE studies are therapeutically the most appropriate (although this has not been studied) and that the drug levels should be kept at or above this limit. With IV vedolizumab, patients' drug levels are below this limit during the entire second half of the 8\u2010week dosing interval. There is no evidence that the limited time that serum concentrations are below the SC serum steady\u2010state levels in the VISIBLE studies increases the risk of relapse, nor for dose\u2010dependent toxicity, if the first SC dose is given in close proximity to the last IV dose.

The time to the maximum serum concentration after administration of vedolizumab subcutaneously is on average 7\u2009days with a variation between 3\u201314\u2009days. Such transient reactions are thus not likely to be an effect of the drug per se but more likely representing nonpharmacological potentially immune\u2010mediated adverse effects, alternatively representing a nocebo effect. Investigating local injection reactions, moderate discomfort, pain or burning sensations were reported by 5%\u201311% of patients, and corresponding severe reactions by 1% of the patients. Conversely, 88%\u201394% reported none or only mild local injection reactions. These results are in line with the VISIBLE studies as well as with data for other SC biologics. SC vedolizumab contains citrate which has been pointed out to be causing pain, but studies that have addressed this issue underscore that citrate is merely one of several factors that may affect potential pain sensation at SC injection and that some of the studies attributing pain at the injection site to citrate are difficult to interpret since citrate was one of several factors modified. Other factors that may be equally important in this context are other buffers commonly used such as phosphate and histidine, the buffer concentration, injected volume, solution temperature, pH, osmolality, needle gauge, injector device, injection speed, injection technique and low body weight.
